<div>Wrong attitude about the pravacy: who care.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>confidential level of this articale:protected. Juda made use of the protected information, sold Jesus. Why did Jesus use prarables: confidential reason. protected and public. origin of human privacy: sin.
<div>privacy 隐私, 隐居</div>

<div>the state or condition of being free from being observed or disturbed by other people. &quot;she returned to the privacy of her own home&quot;</div>

<div>the state of being free from public attention. &quot;a law to restrict newspapers&#39; freedom to invade people&#39;s privacy&quot;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>private: 私人, 阴部</div>

<div>belonging to or for the use of one particular person or group of people only. &quot;all bedrooms have private facilities&quot;</div>

<div>Jesus&#39; words</div>

<div>public:</div>

<div>&quot;有耳可听的、就应当听。&quot; (Mat11:15 CUVS)&nbsp;&quot;He who has ears, let him hear.&quot; (Mat11:15 NIV)</div>

<div>protected:</div>

<div>private:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>be the light and salt.&nbsp;</div>

<div>on one hand, christian should protected from perrsecution and sassasation</div>

<div>on the other hand, Christians need to prepare to sacrifice myrtar.&nbsp;</div>

<div>But Chrsitians be the salt and light must let the world know how and why we die, rathar being said, he died of illness, traffice accidence.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Misuse of provacy</div>

<div>(2)</div>

<div>Communism about Provacy:&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<h1 align="left"><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/communism-computing-china/index.html">Communism and Computer Ethics</a></h1>
</div>

<div>Communism focuses on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm">benefits to society as a whole instead of any individual</a>; the needs of the society are placed above the good of any one person. Egalitarian and public, communism doesn&#39;t grant a right to privacy, a possible threat to the greater good, to any individual unless the privacy provides benefit to society. Privacy is considered essential and important to the citizens and governments of The West. Communism never directly addresses it, as it is a non-issue, clearly falling into an undesired and unnecessary privilege.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>(2) make use of pravacy</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>confliction between the missionary and privacy:</div>

<div>The door of the Noah ark is closing. The name of Jesus has nearly reached to the end of the earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Central CCP&nbsp;school study the Bible.&nbsp;</div>

<div>CCP know Jesus. evidence of video.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Jesus&#39; inner circle disciples: Peter, John and James.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&quot;耶稣对他们说、你们要谨慎、防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵。&quot; (Mat16:6 CUVS)</div>

<div>&quot;&quot;Be careful,&quot; Jesus said to them. &quot;Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&quot;&quot; (Mat16:6 NIV)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Christians in the west must watch out the yeast of the western culture.</div>

<div>Chrisitans in the east must watch out the yeast of the Chinese culture.</div>

<div>Christtians in political circle must watch of the yeast of the world.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The yeast is an anti contextualization process.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Good news:</div>

<div>All people have no provacy under the Lord.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Privacy and missionary: neccessary: persecution.</div>

<div>Policard, disciple of John</div>

<div>Are we ready to scacrifice like Polycard.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Christians have no provacy infront of Jesus, But Christians need keep privacy among the world.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Prayer must be in inner room. Enemy will steal it.</div>

<div>Christians duty to is public the Gospel, but not the protected and privacy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Chinese culture about privacy: GanDanXiangZhao as righteousness.</div>

<div>Chinese must need watch out the&nbsp;Chinese feast.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Chinese evil word: knowing you and me, always win.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Chinese friendship is for info.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The role of pravacy: Abraham surcumsization.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>evidence of pravacy: my FG leader&#39;s email account was haccked. Cheng and Jack.</div>

<div>my WeChat account: blocked, looking for its office fake location.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Personal advocation: use justice device. not to use injustice device. Do bussiness with justce not injustice. Justice driven business.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Joe Osteen prosperious gospel:&nbsp;</div>

<div>&quot;他们栽于耶和华的殿中、发旺在我们　神的院里。&quot; (Psm92:13 CUVS)</div>

<div>&quot;planted in the house of the lord , they will flourish in the courts of our God.&quot; (Psm92:13 NIV)</div>

<div>kill ant house in front of you house.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Privacy vs transparency paradox.</div>

<div>CIU motto: Know Him and make Him Known.</div>
