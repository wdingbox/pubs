<div>Communism about Provacy:&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<h1 align="left"><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/communism-computing-china/index.html">Communism and Computer Ethics</a></h1>
</div>

<div>Communism focuses on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm">benefits to society as a whole instead of any individual</a>; the needs of the society are placed above the good of any one person. Egalitarian and public, communism doesn&#39;t grant a right to privacy, a possible threat to the greater good, to any individual unless the privacy provides benefit to society. Privacy is considered essential and important to the citizens and governments of The West. Communism never directly addresses it, as it is a non-issue, clearly falling into an undesired and unnecessary privilege.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Privacy and missionary: neccessary: persecution.</div>

<div>Policard, disciple of John</div>

<div>Are we ready to scacrifice like Polycard.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Christians have no provacy infront of Jesus, But Christians need keep privacy among the world.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Prayer must be in inner room. Enemy will steal it.</div>

<div>Christians duty to is public the Gospel, but not the protected and privacy.</div>
