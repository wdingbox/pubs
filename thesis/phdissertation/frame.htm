Introduction
 
This study focuses on the correlations between the Chinese Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) and the gospel within a missiological and intercultural framework. It does so by investigating various aspects of the OBI from a biblical perspective and exploring the religious purpose behind the creation of the OBI with historical and archaeological evidence. 
This research originated from an investigation into the connection between modern Chinese characters and Genesis. The inquiry was sparked by Kang’s book The Discovery of Genesis: How the Truths of Genesis Were Found Hidden in the Chinese Language (Kang and Nelson 1979). I first encountered this book through my ESL (English as a Second Language)  teacher at Perimeter Church in Johns Creek, Georgia, around the year 2000, a period when I strongly held atheistic materialism and Darwin’s evolutionism beliefs mixed with some Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Having lived in China since birth for thirty years, my rich emic experience allowed me to understand the Chinese cultural worldview deeply. Modern Chinese people proudly attribute their origins to native apes, asserting an independent evolutionary path within their homeland, untouched by external influences or foreign cultures. They take immense pride in their ancestors, who contributed to the creation of a glorious and splendid civilization. This civilization has endured continuously to the present day, positioning them at the center of nations in the world. From their perspective, the Bible, first completely translated into Chinese and published in the early nineteenth century, appeared merely as foreign religious literature with fantasy and vanity,  having nothing to do with the great Chinese culture. Kang's book, exploring the correlation between Chinese characters and Genesis, profoundly challenged traditional beliefs. It prompted a deep reflection on the intricate relationship between Chinese culture and Christianity, as well as my connection with the Christian faith. While Kang's book wasn't the sole factor in my conversion to Christianity, as I initially harbored doubts about its claims, it undeniably threw my conventional worldview into question. This research signifies my ongoing and deeper exploration of the themes introduced in Kang’s book.
After extensive exploration, I have concluded that Kang’s book on the relationship between modern Chinese characters and Genesis is problematic. Firstly, Kang’s thesis is based on simplified characters published during the Cultural Revolution (1969-1979) by the communists. This raises questions about the validity and consistency of the overall characters’ connections to Genesis. Secondly, the methodology used to establish these connections lacks consistency across all Chinese characters. Thirdly, among hundreds of thousands of Chinese characters, only a limited number of dozens of strictly selected characters can be linked to Genesis. Fourth, the relationship lacks historical and archaeological evidence. The identified connections could arise unintentionally, be contrived, or be influenced by the biases of interpreters. It is not reliable to conclude that the Chinese deliberately concealed the truths of Genesis in the Chinese language. Therefore, the relationship between the modern Chinese characters and Genesis could be deemed as a false proposition—it could be either logically flawed or not verifiable—because it lacks factual connection evidence. Furthermore, within the realm of mystical Chinese culture, it also could potentially be a trap or temptation. 
However, by studying the Chinese etymology, it becomes evident that investigating the OBI characters is more significant and reliable in this research. This is because OBI represents the oldest known form of Chinese writing, dating back to approximately 1300 to 1034 BC, symbolizing the origin of Chinese characters. The study of the OBI characters holds greater validity and reliability compared to modern Chinese characters, which have undergone substantial modifications and developments based on the OBI over several millennia.
Furthermore, when comparing Genesis and the gospel, investigating the relationship with the gospel becomes more significant. This is because the gospel is inherent within Genesis, serving as the core of the Bible and the Christian faith. Significance is always attributed to those elements that have a directly correlated relationship with the gospel. 
Consequently, delving into the relationship between the OBI and the gospel holds greater importance and carries more missiological significance than examining the connection between modern Chinese characters and Genesis, despite the greater challenges due to the extensive time span and the fundamental cultural discrepancy. If the relationship between the OBI and the gospel could be clarified, many other issues, including the relationship between Chinese characters and Genesis, could be resolved. This clarification would be significant for newly reborn Christians and those who are preparing to be missionaries in Chinese culture.

Rationale and Need for Study

The primary audience for this research comprises missionaries engaged in the daunting task of establishing a sustainable Christian foundation in the mystical and assimilative Chinese culture. The history of Christianity in China reveals a recurring pattern—a short period of flourishing followed by a long period of disappearance—in stark contrast to the stable, endurable, and assimilative nature of the mystical Chinese culture. A typical example is the rising and mysterious vanishing of Nestorian Christianity in central China between the seventh and tenth centuries (Baum 2003, 5, 46-51). 
In recent decades, missiological contextualization has become increasingly favored as a strategy for disrupting the cyclical pattern by seamlessly implanting the gospel into local cultures. It addresses previous issues with missionary planting that overlooked the significance of local culture. However, contextualization presents missionaries with challenges as they endeavor to grasp the intricacies and essence of local cultures, particularly within the context of the complex and mystical Chinese culture. Despite the richness of Chinese cultural studies, there has been limited exploration of the essence of Chinese culture from a missiological perspective, resulting in a lack of effective cultural elements applicable to contextualization. This study aims to overcome these issues by focusing on the profound internal relationship between the core of Chinese culture, represented by the OBI, and the essence of Christianity, embodied in the gospel. It intends to unveil the essence of the mystical and assimilative Chinese culture, shedding light on fundamental cultural elements eligible for effective contextualization to break the cyclic pattern.
As a missiological research that requires the study from both biblical and scientific perspectives, academic professionals such as Chinese archaeologists, historians, theologists, and OBI researchers are crucial academic readers. They possess the decisive authority to critique or evaluate the validity and reliability of the OBI research while simultaneously gleaning insights from it. This research stands to benefit the OBI scholars particularly and holds the potential to reinvigorate academic interest in OBI studies. Over the past seventy years, there has been a notable absence of significant theoretical breakthroughs, such as the two-thirds of the unresolved OBI pictograms, the origin of the OBI, the motivation behind the OBI invention, the essence of the OBI religion, the nature of the inheritance and mutation of the OBI, and so on. The current achievements in research were primarily established on an atheistic and evolutionary foundation, with a golden period during the first fifty years following the discovery of OBI in 1899. In the OBI research field, there is a pressing need for innovative methodologies or new paradigms. This research could pave the way for those breakthroughs.
The study of the OBI is not only highly important in Chinese culture and archaeology but is also crucial for missiological study. This is because the OBI, the earliest form of Chinese writing, represents the core of mythical Chinese culture. The mystery of the OBI, such as the ethnicity of the OBI practitioners, directly intertwines with the mystery of Chinese culture, posing difficulties for both missionaries and the Chinese themselves in comprehending its intricate essence. Failure to grasp the nature of Chinese culture has historically played a significant role in repeatedly losing the missionary battleground in China. A notable instance is the retreat of Jesuit missionaries from China in the early eighteenth century, prompted by the Chinese Rites Controversy due to their inability to comprehend the essence of Chinese ancestor worship. The study directly challenges the myth of the OBI with the top three essential questions: what is the origin, source of power, and destiny? (Cashin 2016). Answering these questions could offer missionaries a fascinating glimpse into ancient Chinese civilization, providing valuable insights into language, history, and culture.
Conversely, Christians should not anticipate that secular scientific research can entirely demystify the Chinese culture. Nor should they expect that Chinese culture could fundamentally change its mystical nature through radical cultural revolutions. The May Fourth Movement of 1919 and the Communism Movement after 1949 are the latest solid evidence. For the gospel to deeply embed itself within a mystical and assimilative culture, missionaries must delve into its most profound inner cultural layers themselves. They must actively unravel any mysteries that obstruct its path, as the gospel, representing truth, cannot coexist with enigmatic or mystical elements. People who immersed themselves in the mystical culture often perceive the Christian faith merely as a fantasy or vanity. Therefore, demystifying the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI), the core of the mystical Chinese culture becomes an essential step and obligation for missionaries to establish a lasting foundation within the intricate Chinese cultural landscape. Meanwhile, the Chinese populace eagerly anticipates a satisfying answer to the mystery of the OBI. For instance, it was reported in 2016 that the National Museum of Chinese Writing (中國文字博物館) in Anyang of Henan province launched a program to offer a hefty reward of CNY 100,000 (about USD 13,000) per character for those who could decipher the approximate 4,000 symbols that remain unknown.  This advertised market value mirrors the social interest and demand of the OBI study.
In conclusion, while the dissertation primarily centers on missionary planting church issues in China through the study of OBI, it provides insight into the common core myths hidden within Chinese culture, benefiting intercultural studies related to mythology in other areas, including India, the Arab world, South America, and beyond. This inclusive approach also enriches missiological studies in numerous aspects, empowering Christians not to be assimilated by culture but to transcend it. As the Chinese culture assumes increasing influence on the global stage, understanding its essence and ultimate mystical purpose becomes crucial for all. “We have smart adversaries,” Alex Karp said. “Our enemies are ancient cultures fighting for their survival, not just now but for the next thousand years.” (PYMNTS 2024).




 
Research Problem, Limitations, Terms

Specific Research Question

In this research, I will investigate the relationship between the OBI and the gospel, focusing on the central research question: 
How can the concealed prophetic relationship between the OBI and the gospel be uncovered through intercultural and missiological perspectives, thereby testifying to the authenticity of the gospel? 
The OBI refers to the mythical inscriptions on the bones unearthed in Anyang. The gospel mainly denotes the story of Jesus, which is faithfully recorded in the first four books of the New Testament. 
Secondary Research Questions

1.	How can the mythical phenomena in Chinese history and archeology align with the supernatural religious aspects of the OBI to help reveal its prophetic connection to the gospel?
2.	How can exploring the origin of the OBI from intercultural and missiological perspectives help establish a foundation for understanding the prophetic relationship between the OBI and the gospel?
3.	What historical, archaeological, and intercultural evidence can be found to support or undermine the prophetic connection between the OBI and the gospel?

Scope and Limitations
 
This research is strictly within the scope at the academic intersection of Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) study and missiology within the intercultural domain. From the perspective of the OBI study, the research is an ongoing effort to explore multiple aspects of the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI). Over the past century, academic scholars have compiled a comprehensive vocabulary of 5,000 to 6,000 unique characters from a staggering collection of nearly 1.5 million pictorial symbols. These symbols were found on approximately 53,834 bone fragments out of a total of 130,000 to 160,000 pieces of oracle bones unearthed. Although about one third of the vocabulary can be connected to modern Chinese characters, a considerable portion of them remains a mystery. 
 As previous scholars have already completed the groundwork, this research will not examine the process of collecting characters from the oracle bones or selecting identical characters to form the vocabulary. Instead, it will focus on exploring the original, lost meanings of each character within the vocabulary. The ultimate goal is to uncover the religious connotations associated with the OBI, enabling their interpretation through the gospel. However, this research will not examine the entire corpus of bone inscriptions for their topics, themes, or meanings, nor will it analyze their grammatical patterns, given the ongoing debate over whether they should be classified as human readable documental text or religious ritual practice remains.
Within a missiological scope, the research significantly cooperates with archaeology. It will investigate the physical characteristics of the unearthed oracle bones artifacts to assist deep understanding of characters in the vocabulary. This includes investigating types of bones; the elaborate marks found on the bones caused by drilling, chiseling, cutting, and burning; and the correlation between these marks and the characters on the bones. The research aims to unravel the functionalities, roles, and purposes of the marks within the framework of ancient Chinese divination practices. However, the study will not investigate the authentication of the oracle bones or the methods for distinguishing genuine bones or inscriptions from fakes since the number of arguable bone inscriptions is limited and is not used in this research. 
The research will also explore various archaeological materials associated with the OBI near the archaeological relics in Anyang City. It will involve studying other unearthed materials besides oracle bone artifacts and investigating the surrounding excavation sites like tombs, ash pits, sacrifice ditches, temple foundations, and so on. In addition, while the archaeological inquiry will expand to other geographical areas in mainland China, it will be limited to the same contexts that are closely associated with the OBI. 
As an intercultural study, this archaeological research may extend to broader biblical areas, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the land of Canaan. The goal is to expand the knowledge base on Chinese history through the intercultural connection. For example, while turtle symbolism practice is abundant and enduring in Chinese history, scholarly research and documentation on its specific meanings and interpretations are relatively scarce. Through intercultural connections, the abundant interpretation of turtle symbolism in Egypt and Mesopotamia can be used to help understand the role and meaning of Chinese turtle symbolism. 
While the study will collaborate with anthropology, its primary focus will be on the religious aspect. Other facets, such as politics, economics, technology, and society, are not the main focus of this investigation. The broader archaeological inquiry aims to elucidate the potential relationship between the OBI and earlier global civilizations, focusing on uncovering the origin of the OBI and the religious motivations behind its creation. The objective of the worldwide archaeological investigation is not to explore ancient globalization but rather to shed light on the religious context and origins of the OBI.
Unlike certain studies on Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) in the field, this research deliberately refrains from relying on classical Chinese documents while maintaining a historical perspective. This is because this research does not consider classical Chinese documents as sufficiently reliable references despite their potential to support this research. For example, the book, Dao De Scripture, by LaoDang, written in the 6th BC, has multiple versions, but none of them can be confirmed to be the original. However, detailed discussions or reasons regarding the issues with classical Chinese documents will not be the focus of this research.
While this research is within the field of missiology, it will not address the history of Christian missionary activities in China or the lessons of the repeated failures of missionary outreach in China. Instead, it will merely explore a fundamental strategy for long-term missionary planting in China. Specifically, the research aims to imbue the mystical OBI with potential significance in Chinese culture while remaining faithful to the gospel, thus making the OBI suitable for contextualization. However, detailed discussions on how such contextualization can be applied to Chinese culture will not be included in the study.

Key Terms

1.	OBI: In Chinese archaeology or history, OBI refers to the Chinese Oracle Bone Inscriptions, dating back to approximately 1300 to 1034 BC, also known as the Turtle Bone Inscriptions, discovered at Anyang, Henan.  
2.	Mythical vs Mystical: In this research, mythical refers to something that is often traditional, legendary, superstitious, or culturally significant but cannot be verified. Mystical relates to something that involves a sense of connection to a divine or transcendent reality beyond ordinary human experience.

Literature Review

This section provides concise literature reviews of carefully selected scholarly works, comprising dissertations, articles, books, and book chapters, considered pivotal for this dissertation. While these reviews offer valuable insights into existing research, they serve to underscore the uniqueness of the dissertation and its contribution to filling gaps within its academic domains. This review encompasses four parts: closely related works, important supporting archaeological works, theological foundation, and significant methodology.


Closely Related Works
In the book The Gospel Hidden in Chinese Characters (Boyle 2015), the author analyzes more than 200 Chinese characters from the perspective of the Bible. Some of the character analysis is associated with the actual origin of the character from the OBI, though the connection is superficial. One notable feature of the book is the author's observation regarding the parallels between the history of Chinese characters and the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphics is a word taken from Greek and literally means “holy characters.” 
Another significant aspect of the book is its analysis of Chinese characters through a gospel lens rather than through the Bible stories or Genesis. The depth and scope of this study exceed those found in works such as The Discovery of Genesis (Kang and Nelson 1979), Genesis and the Mystery Confucius Couldn't Solve (Ethel 1994), Genesis in Ancient China (Chock 2015), and Bible Stories Hidden in Chinese Characters (Boyle 1990). Despite incorporating elements of ancient Egyptian culture, the author acknowledges the book's lack of academic credentials about the intercultural connection between China and Egypt, encouraging readers to explore further to fill the intercultural gap. 
Additionally, Boyle’s book offers thought-provoking inquiries for readers. These inquiries challenge the theological notion that the gospel applies universally to all cultures worldwide, even predating Christ. This theological concept will serve as both the cornerstone and driving force of this dissertation, guiding the investigation into the intersection of ancient Chinese culture and the Christian religion.


In the article “Revelation in the Chinese Characters: Divine or Divined?” (Chua 2006), the author critically critiques the claiming theory that biblical messages are embedded in Chinese characters. This theory is primarily expounded in two major books:  The Discovery of Genesis (Kang and Nelson 1979), and  Genesis and the Mystery Confucius Couldn't Solve (Nelson 1994). The critique examines these books from three fundamental aspects: reliability, validity, and methodology. 
Chua concludes that the current missiological approach to interpreting and communicating the gospel through Chinese characters is flawed. He argues that this method lacks reliability, scientific rigor, and theological validity. While the connection between the Chinese characters and the gospel can help bring some to Jesus, it inadvertently assigns divine attributes to Chinese characters, making Chinese characters more mystical and powerful, and detracting from the universal message of the gospel. Consequently, there is a risk that this approach may reinforce tendencies toward syncretism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, or patriotism. 
 The author admits that many pastors or scholars disagree with his critique. For example, Boyle states, “Even if the interpretation I give to a particular character does not, in fact, agree with the original etymology of the character (which is usually unknowable anyway), as long as it serves my purpose as a communication tool for the gospel, then I will not hesitate to use it.” (Boyle 2015, 25) 
While a definitive replacement solution remains elusive in the article, underscoring the enduring complexity of these challenges, Dr. Chua's critique significantly shapes the trajectory of this dissertation. It catalyzes a deeper exploration into archaeological and intercultural studies, which becomes a pivotal approach for the dissertation. This shift in focus aims to address the multifaceted nature of the Chinese characters, which emphasizes academic significance within its culture while remaining faithful to the gospel.

The publication of the book The Dictionary of Yinxu Oracle Bone Inscriptions Study (Guo 2020) proves invaluable for quickly gaining a comprehensive understanding of the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) study. It compiles commonly recognized characters, phrases, and texts, along with their interpreted meanings. Moreover, the book profiles approximately five hundred notable scholars or collectors who have made significant contributions to the study since its initial discovery in 1899. Each entry provides a brief introduction, including details such as date of birth, publications, and historical background, offering readers a well-rounded perspective on the field. Additionally, the dictionary includes entries on prominent research works and publications, complemented by concise reviews. The appendix provides a detailed chronicle of the OBI study from 1899 to 2016, comprising historical milestones and academic accomplishments. This section aids readers in comprehending the research history, trends, and key features of the field. 
While the publication stands as a cornerstone in the current landscape of OBI study, representing the academic authority and consensus opinions, it is not without its limitations. A prominent concern lies in its heavy reliance on an atheist, evolutionary, and indigenous framework, potentially constraining the breadth of its analysis. Furthermore, the absence of critiques and alternative perspectives, exemplified by Professor Huang QiYi's work, "Criticism of Research of Shang and Zhou Dynasties" (Huang, 2008), represents a significant drawback. This deficiency hampers the development of creative and critical thinking and overlooks the incorporation of diverse viewpoints into the discourse. Nonetheless, despite these shortcomings, the book retains its status as a vital reference and foundational resource, providing the starting point and knowledge basis for this dissertation.

In the twin works The Wasteland of History: Ancient Cultural Philosophical Structure (Huang 1995)  and Criticism of the Research of Shang and Zhou Dynasties: Origin and Development of Ancient Chinese Characters (Huang 2008), the author boldly criticized the current prevailing oracle bone study foundations established since the initial discovery of the oracle bones in 1899. From religious, linguistic, and historical perspectives, Huang points out that the purpose behind the creation of the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) is not primarily concerned with divination for omens. Instead, it serves as memoranda following ceremonial sacrificial offerings to invoke a deity. The OBI is not representative of a human language but a part of the religious ritual. He states that despite the advanced development of Chinese characters (the OBI), the pre-Confucian Chinese civilization remained largely illiterate, leading Dr. Huan to borrow a term from astronomy and call it “a black hole.” (Huang 1995). 
Huang's theory about the connection between the OBI and deity can align with the discourse in this dissertation on the relationship between the OBI and the gospel. The significant difference is that the gospel is perfectly testified to be the truth, whereas the concept of deity in Huang’s theory is still elusive and cannot be clearly articulated. Huang’s creativity lies in adopting religious study and breaking the traditional dominance of the atheist and evolutionary platform. However, Huang’s theory will confront new challenges without integrating missiology and intercultural study, maintaining the original issues as myths. Indeed, not only is the pre-Confucian Chinese civilization a black hole, but the core of Chinese culture is still a black hole today. 

In the book The Study of the Root Characters in the Vocabulary of the OBI (Ji 2003), the author extracts 485 roots from 5,319 characters of the vocabulary of the OBI. Among them, 57 roots cannot be used standalone. The author also depicts the hierarchy tree for each root. The academic study of prefixes, roots, and suffixes, along with their meanings and origins, falls under the broader field of morphology. 
The author’s study can be called the OBI morphology. It is the study of the structure and forms of characters, including their constituent parts such as affixes (prefixes, suffixes), roots, and stems, and how they combine to create meaningful units in the OBI. Analyzing these components helps linguists understand the principles underlying word formation and the relationships between words within a language.
The morphological analysis of the OBI substantially decreases the number of characters without diminishing its religious significance within the study. This reduction is instrumental in deepening our comprehension of the essence of the OBI, fostering improved study efficiency. Furthermore, this morphological approach facilitates streamlined character searches within the vocabulary.
Diverse worldviews can significantly impact the outcomes of morphological analysis. While the author adheres to the traditional Chinese approach to morphological analysis, reflecting the modern Chinese character root system in its result, this dissertation will adopt a missiological perspective for morphological analysis, potentially leading to distinct findings.

Important Supporting Archaeological Works
The book Anyang (Li 1977) by Li Chi (1896-1979) stands as a crucial primary resource for the dissertation. From 1928 to 1937, Dr. Li, the chief archaeologist, and his team extensively excavated the site of Anyang. The pinnacle of their endeavors came with the unearthing of the grand royal tombs and the renowned YH127 pitch, an evenly shaped pit that contains over 17,000 pieces of whole oracle bones, the largest number ever unearthed at Yinxu. Through firsthand accounts and materials, the book vividly portrays Dr. Li's experiences and the archaeological findings at Anyang.
One compelling piece of evidence is the discovery of several thousand skeletal remains collected from various sites in Anyang, including skulls recovered from sacrifice pits. Analysis of these primitive skulls reveals that they belong to different ethnic groups, including classic Mongoloid, Oceanic Negroid, Caucasoid, Eskimoid, and others. These findings serve as striking evidence that rebuts the theory suggesting that Chinese culture developed independently in isolation.
Li’s book also discusses an intended excavation for the ink-writing on wood and bamboo strip documents. Dr. Li states, “But in this direction, our field workers were not as successful as in the case of oracle bone hunting.” But Dr. Li insists, “This failure, however, does not mean that documents of the ink-writing type did not exist. They may be hidden elsewhere, or they may have entirely disintegrated or been destroyed” (Li 1977, 120). 
Despite Dr. Li’s college education in America, his perspective was mainly shaped by Chinese historical documents and an evolutionary viewpoint. The narrative surrounding the intended excavation suggests that the archaeological materials presented to the public may be somewhat influenced by bias. This encourages Christians to confront the professional authority to uncover the myths to expose the truth. 

The book Yinxu Bronze Vessels Study (Li Chi 2017) is a collection of Li Chi’s papers published from 1964 to 1972, concerning the bronze vessels discovered in tombs around the Yinxu site at Anyang. It meticulously examines various types of bronze vessels, totaling 53 pieces, including discussions on bronze characters, vessel forms, and decorated patterns known as Taotie. Li Chi also explores the correlation between the shapes of bronze vessels and the characters found in the OBI. However, the book does not cover bronze weapons or other types of bronze artifacts, instead focusing on identifying different bronze vessels and their functionalities. 
The coexistence of both bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions at the same site and during the same period is noteworthy. While the bronze characters have persisted throughout history, the OBI abruptly disappeared. This stark contrast in phenomenon offers insights into the purpose behind the creation of the characters. It also underscores the significance of considering bronze characters when studying the OBI. However, the book does not delve into these issues and reasons for the transition of characters from bones to bronzes.
Additionally, the book highlights that bronze vessels are predominantly found in tombs, whereas bones are often discovered in ash pits. This distinction provides insights into the motivations and functions of the OBI, although the book does not address this aspect. 

	In the paper “A View on Hunghuai/Jianghuai Civilization from the Perspective of Unearthed Turtles in Chinese Prehistory” (Fan and Zhang 2008),  the authors delve into archaeological excavation documents concerning prehistoric turtles found in China's Huanghai and Jianhai regions. It explores the prehistoric phenomenon of turtle usage and examines its cultural significance for social regimes, original worship practices, and ceremonial systems. 
The author Fan observes three phenomena in the region: Firstly, turtle shells were discovered in various locations alongside human remains within tombs. Secondly, turtle shells were positioned beneath the base of pillars within buildings. Thirdly, turtle shells were unearthed within ash pits. The author also found that an average of 3.82% of excavated tombs in the region contain turtle artifacts, with some having pebbles inside, some featuring holes and decorations, and some being made of jade, pottery, or stone. 
Based on the observations and analyses, the author suggests that the unearthed turtles were associated with ancient superstitions, divination, spiritual worship, or ritual sacrifice in prehistory. The author attempts to establish a connection between the prehistoric turtles and the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI), proposing a continuity of turtle symbolism in Chinese culture. This implies that prehistoric turtle culture may have served as a precursor to the OBI culture.
Fan's research remains reliable despite the absence of pictures in the paper, as these images can be found in other reports and documents. Additionally, numerous other archaeological studies related to prehistoric turtles are available. The continuity of turtle symbolism can be observed nationwide in mainland China today, from the Imperial Forbidden City in Beijing to historical relics and Buddhist temples in the local countryside.
While the paper lacks discussion on the origin and symbolic meaning of turtle culture, mainly due to its limited perspective, it provides significant insights into the study of the origin of the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) and the purpose behind the creation of the OBI in the dissertation.

The book Research on Late Shang Dynasty Tombs at Yin Xu (Hu 2010) primarily investigates the tombs of the late Shang Dynasty at Yinxu, covering in-depth discussions on the late-period history, culture, and archaeology of Yinxu. The book includes analyses and interpretations of the tombs, artifacts, and historical background discovered at the Yinxu site, helping us better understand the history and culture of ancient China. 
While the author's primary focus may not center on the relationship between the tomb and the OBI, the archaeological evidence presented offers valuable insights. These findings can substantiate the connection between the OBI and the tombs, shedding light on the purpose behind the OBI's creation—its association with concepts of eternal life and death.  
For instance, tombs during the early ancient stage frequently displayed a cross-shaped layout, a characteristic that gradually declined over time. The resemblance of these cross-style tomb layouts to the Christian cross is striking, offering a potential clue to the connection between the gospel and the OBI. 

The book The Oracle Bone Inscriptions from Huayanzhuang East (Schwartz 2019) serves as a valuable resource, offering firsthand accounts of archaeological excavations conducted at the Huayanzhuang site, with a specific emphasis on oracle bone inscriptions. The inclusion of numerous pictures and data pertaining to the oracle bone inscriptions enriches the content, providing readers with a comprehensive visual and empirical understanding of the inscriptions and their contextual significance.
Of particular interest is the author's observation regarding the character "Zi" (子), which translates to "son." The author proposes that "Zi" may represent the name of a diviner associated with the inscriptions, adding depth to our comprehension of the divination process. This interpretation offers valuable insights into the individuals involved in the ancient practices, contributing to a deeper understanding of the cultural and religious context.
Furthermore, the exploration of the connection between the oracle bone inscriptions and the gospel, as suggested by the author's findings regarding the character "Zi," presents an intriguing avenue for further research. This connection may offer valuable insights into the religious and cultural exchanges between different civilizations, providing fertile ground for scholarly exploration and analysis within the context of the dissertation.

In the book A Study of the Hollows on Oracle Bones (Xu 1979), Xu delves into the diverse forms present in the oracle bones, encompassing drilling, chiseling, and cutting marks. This scientific approach sets it apart from other studies, as it minimizes ideological influence. Xu's investigation serves as a valuable resource for the dissertation, offering insight into the relationship with the OBI and aiding in comprehending the motivation behind its creation and its role in religious practices.

In the paper, “Oracle-Bone Color Pigments” (Britton 1937), the author observes that colorful materials remain on many of the oracle bones dating roughly from 1400 to 1100 BC found near Anyang, Henan. The colors observed include black and various reds, often appearing as fading traces on the surface, reminiscent of a varnish. They are also found within the incised lines of writing, carefully applied to illuminate the inscriptions. Representative specimens were selected for chemical micro-analysis, revealing cinnabar as the red pigment. While the analysis for the black pigment is inconclusive, it suggests the presence of carbon or organic matter, possibly resembling ink, with the intriguing possibility of involving ritual blood not excluded. 
The potential correlation between oracle bones and the presence of carbon or organic material offers significant insight into how the markings made on oracle bones may have been linked to their roles and functions in ritual ceremonies. It reinforces the notion that oracle bones could have been utilized in rituals involving human sacrifice. However, no other comparable laboratory tests have been made since 1937, leaving lingering questions unanswered to this day.

In the article “The Accounts of the Origin of Writing from Sumer, Egypt, and China — A Comparative Perspective” (Gong et al. 2009), the author Gong Yushu offers a distinctive approach to studying the origin of writing by comparing three historical accounts from Sumer, Egypt, and China. This approach provides both a historical (vertical) and cultural (horizontal) perspective while maintaining scientific logic by relying on archaeological evidence to support its arguments. Although the article does not comprehensively address all the questions posed, it offers valuable insights into the origin of writing by juxtaposing and analyzing early historical accounts, highlighting both commonalities and differences among them.  In detail, the article discusses four topics: 
1)	Who invented writing? 
2)	Reason for the creation of writing.
3)	Forerunners of writing.
4)	The social function of writing.

While the author finds that “the historical accounts of the origin of writing embedded in myths, epics and other genres of literature known from ancient literal civilizations like the Sumerian, the Egyptian and the Chinese, mirror such a quest of the ancient inquiring minds,” (Gong 2009, 137) he tends to underscore that “Writing is something achieved during a certain stage of the development of human society” (Gong 2009, 146).
While the article does not delve deeply into discussing the interrelationships among civilizations, it sheds light on the chronological development of three civilizations, thereby inspiring further research into understanding their origin of interrelationships. At the very least, the article demonstrates that the OBI is comparable to other earlier writing systems.   

In the book The Religion of Ancient Egypt (Petrie, 1906), the author offers valuable insights into the religious beliefs and practices of ancient Egyptians, drawing from archaeological evidence, inscriptions, and texts. His meticulous research and scholarly analysis contribute significantly to our understanding of one of the world's most enduring civilizations.
In this book, Petrie delves into various aspects of Egyptian religion, including beliefs, rituals, deities, and religious practices. He examines the role of gods and goddesses in Egyptian mythology, the significance of temples and cults, the practice of mummification, and the concept of the afterlife.
Moreover, Petrie suggests a connection between Egyptian religion and Chinese religion, albeit with distinct forms. He argues that while some ancient theologies, like those of the Hindu tradition, feature a profusion of gods and godlings, others, such as those of the Chinese, emphasize animistic spirits and employ systems like Shamanism for conciliating them. Petrie posits, "But all our knowledge of the early positions and nature of great gods shows them to stand on an entirely different footing to these varied spirits" (Petrie, 1906, p. 6).
This assertion is crucial for understanding the religious roots and underlying meanings behind various cultural practices, including the creation and significance of the OBI. By exploring the connections between ancient Egyptian religion and other belief systems, scholars can gain deeper insights into the evolution and diversity of religious traditions across civilizations.

In the book, Worlds Full of Signs: Ancient Greek Divination in Context (Beerden, 2013), the author explores the practice of divination in ancient Greek society within its broader cultural, religious, and historical contexts. While this book did not offer any information related to the OBI, it is a good reference for intercultural comparative study.
In this book, Beerden delves into various forms of divination practiced in ancient Greece, such as oracles, dreams, and omens, examining their significance, methods, and interpretations. The author situates these divinatory practices within the social, religious, and philosophical framework of ancient Greek culture, shedding light on how individuals and communities understood and interacted with the divine through divination.
The author offers insights into the role of divination in ancient Greek religious life, political decision-making, and personal guidance, exploring its complexities and nuances. Through a comprehensive analysis of textual, archaeological, and artistic evidence, Beerden provides readers with a deeper understanding of the cultural and religious dynamics of ancient Greek society.
Overall, the book contributes to the scholarly discourse on ancient Greek religion, offering a nuanced exploration of divination and its place within the broader tapestry of Greek cultural and religious practices. In addition, the book offers a methodology for interpreting the signs present in the ancient world, offering a way for the human interpretation of these supernatural signs in the dissertation.
In the paper “Divination and Power: A Multi-regional View of the Development of Oracle Bone Divination in Early China” (Flad 2008), the author considers the Chinese oracle bone divination as a type of osteomancy (animal bone divination). Other types include pyro-osteomancy (a type of divination that involves throwing bones onto a cloth or the floor and analyzing their position to determine an answer) and apyromantic (examining the scapula of an animal after its death). Animal bone divination existed in East and Northeast Asia since prehistoric times. The practice is related to both religion and social power. The author also examines the relationship between divination practice and social power during the Neolithic, Shang, and Zhou periods in China. The author’s observation could help the OBI study to confirm that OBI is not merely a fake superstition but a type of divination associated with superpower. From a biblical perspective, all power is understood to originate from God. However, the paper lacks in-depth exploration regarding the mechanics of this relationship, the underlying motivations, and the methods through which practitioners access power from God.
In the paper “A Study of the Words in Shang Bronze Inscriptions” (Chu 2004), the author analyzes the special features of characters of the Shang Bronze Inscriptions from four aspects. First, he analyzes words of bronze inscriptions from 30 pieces of representative Shang Bronze. Second, he compares them with Shang oracle bone inscriptions since words appear on both. Third,  he tries to decide the possible period of time for certain words in Shang Bronze inscriptions; some of them might be dated as belonging to the late Shang Dynasty. Forth, he also analyzes some abnormal words in Shang Bronze inscriptions. 
This paper will be very helpful in understanding the role of the OBI in ancient times by comparing the oracle bones and bronzes.  

Theological Works 
In the book Jesus the Son of God (Carson 2012), D.A. Carson explores the significance of the title "Son of God" ascribed to Jesus Christ in the New Testament. Carson delves into the historical, theological, and exegetical aspects of this title, addressing its implications for understanding the identity, nature, and mission of Jesus within Christian theology.
The book engages with various scholarly debates surrounding the interpretation of the title "Son of God" and its significance in both biblical and contemporary contexts. Carson offers insights into how the title was understood within the cultural and religious milieu of the ancient world, as well as its theological implications for Christian faith and practice today. Carson’s book is regarded as a significant contribution to the study of Christology and the New Testament, offering readers a comprehensive examination of the multifaceted dimensions of Jesus' identity as the Son of God.
A deep understanding of the sonship of Jesus is important not only for the Christians but also for the scholars to study the relationship between the gospel and the OBI. Many scholars have noticed the exceptional concept of sonship in the OBI and ancient Chinese culture. Scholar Cai Zhemao is one of those who particularly discusses the question, “Who is the son in the OBI of the East Huayuanzhuang?” (Cai 2017, 1). The concept of sonship was popular in ancient times globally, even before Christ. For instance, Chinese culture started with sons of sages, like the son of Kong (Confucianism), the son of Lao (Daoism), the son of Meng (Mengism), and so on. The central theme of the OBI is also the sonship. In ancient times, before Christ, from some prophetic perspective, every son was possibly the Son of God.    

Missiological Works
	In the book Contextualization: Meanings, Methods, and Models (Hesselgrave 2000) by David Hesselgrave (1924-2018), the author introduces a crucial aspect of contextualization: balancing faithfulness and meaningfulness. The author acknowledges that in a variety of materials attached to contextualization, “some of them are more consistent with Scripture and the historic Christian faith, and therefore are more authentic than others.” (Hesselgrave 2000, 199). However, whether faithfulness or meaningfulness, they have to be authentic. The author points out that, “authenticity should have to do with God’s revelation first of all, with faithfulness to the authority and content of the will of God as revealed in his creation, in man’s conscience, and, especially, in his Son and his Holy Spirit—inspired Word.” (Hesselgrave 2000, 199)
From this point of view, Christian contextualization can be thought of as the attempt to communicate the message of the persons, works, Word, and will of God in a way that is faithful to God’s revelation. In order to understand what is involved in communicating the Christian gospel to respondents in other cultures, the author proposes a seven-dimension paradigm (Hesselgrave 2000, 203):
1.	Worldviews—ways of viewing the world.
2.	Cognitive process—ways of thinking.
3.	Linguistic forms—ways of expressing ideas.
4.	Behavioral patterns—ways of acting.
5.	Communication media—ways of channeling the message.
6.	Social structures—ways of interacting.
7.	Motivational sources—ways of deciding.

Hesselgrave’s authentic contextualization implies that while faithfulness and meaningfulness are two aspects in analysis, spiritually speaking, they are inseparable. His approach contributes to the methodology of the missiological dissertation, serving as a significant guide in the research on decoding the OBI. 

In the book Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (Eliade 1964), Eliade delves into the rituals, practices, beliefs, and experiences associated with shamanism, presenting it as a widespread and ancient religious phenomenon characterized by ecstatic trance states and communication with the spirit world. Through extensive research and analysis of ethnographic and historical sources, Eliade examines the role of the shaman as a mediator between the human and spirit realms, exploring themes such as healing, divination, soul flight, and cosmology in shamanic traditions worldwide.
The book has been highly influential in the study of comparative religion, anthropology, and the history of religions, shaping scholarly understandings of shamanism and its significance in human culture and spirituality. It remains a foundational text in the field and continues to be widely read and cited by scholars and researchers interested in the cross-cultural exploration of religious experiences and spiritual practices.

In the article “A Deconstructive Analysis of K. C. Chang's Shamanic Approach in Chinese Archaeology” (Qu 2017), the author Feng Qu analyzes the early Chinese shamanism hypothesis popularized in the 1980s by influential archaeologist Kwang-Chih Chang (1931-2001). The article keenly observes that Chang’s hypothesis essentially stems from a mixture of Chinese historiography and Western shamanism theory. The author exhibits a contradictory stance towards this mixed approach of interpreting Neolithic and Bronze Age materials. On one hand, the author contends that both Chinese historiography and shamanism are problematic. First, the evidence in Chinese historiography lags millennia behind and is deemed unreliable for understanding the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods. Second, Chang’s definition of shamanism is uncertain. The author expresses his opinion with Putt’s words, “Chang did not indicate which scholarly definition of shamanism he had in mind in making these arguments, but he did occasionally refer to Eliade” (Qu 2017, 111)
On the other hand, the author agrees that Chang’s theory is creative and insightful. For example, Chang explained the animal images on the Shang and Zhou bronzes as helping spirits that assist the shaman in flying to other worlds. 
Given its sophisticated nature, the author's analysis of Chang's intricate shamanism theory is commendable. Despite lingering concerns, Chang's shamanism holds acceptability and usefulness. Indeed, the crux of the matter does not solely lie in the mixed approach but rather in the absence of a standardized referencing system within the entire framework. By embracing missiological and intercultural perspectives, the author and Chang both could readily address the issues outlined in the article.

	In the paper “Stimulus Diffusion” (Kroeber 1940), A.L. Kroeber, introduces the concept of stimulus diffusion or idea diffusion, which refers to a phenomenon occurring during the process of cultural spread. In this special case, a specific idea is accepted in the receiving culture to develop new content, but its original content is rejected for some reason. Kroeber emphasizes that stimulus diffusion often occurs with minimal historical evidence. He states, “In other words, much stimulus diffusion takes place below the surface of the historical records” (Kroeber 1940, 1). While the connection between two contents may be indubitable, the evidence is typically indirect or inferred. 
As an example in his paper, Kroeber applies his principle of stimulus diffusion to assign a specific origin to Egyptian, Mesopotamian, or Chinese writing. He elucidates that although connection evidence may be scarce, at the very least, “the time-space relation is such as inevitably to suggest a connection.” (Kroeber 1940, 10).   
Kroeber’s theory is easier to verify in our contemporary society than in ancient times. Essentially, stimulus diffusion resembles a form of plagiarism, wherein one adopts another's ideas and presents them as their own using different words or contexts without proper acknowledgment. However, stimulus diffusion is not considered illicit in cultural exchanges and occurs widely. For example, China adopted the concept of internet search engines from Google and developed its own system, Baidu, which has become integral to its culture and society. Meanwhile, Google is entirely inaccessible in China. Although the connection between Baidu and Google is undeniable today, evidence of this influence may be difficult to trace, especially over a long period of time in the future. 
Kroeber’s theory of stimulus diffusion holds significance in missiology as well. For instance, in recent decades in China, the gospel's teaching of peace, patience, tolerance, and hospitality has been widely accepted and integrated into social propaganda and public policy, leading to improved social harmony and prosperity. Meanwhile, the dissemination of the gospel itself is not widely accepted and constrained in public domains. This stimulus diffusion illustrates the widespread assimilative tendency of cultures worldwide towards religious concepts, thereby presenting significant challenges for missionaries in their endeavors to establish long-term, sustainable planting efforts without being assimilated by the local culture.
Kroeber's theory illustrates how two apparently distinct cultures might share identical underlying concepts, serving as the foundation for intercultural exchange. Moreover, his theory suggests that while cultures maintain their unique identities, none can thrive in isolation from external influences. Furthermore, the theory implies that every culture has its own myths. By demystifying one myth, other myths can be demystified. 
In conclusion, the stimulus diffusion theory offers a theoretical foundation for the continuity between the OBI and hieroglyphics. By studying ancient Egypt culture, the essence of ancient Chinese religion can be revealed. 

In the books Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye (Arnheim 1954) and Visual Thinking (Arnheim 1969),  Rudolf Arnheim (1904 – 2007) applies Gestalt psychology to visual perception and cognition processes, proposing many practical theories appliable to art and language analysis. In the book Art and Visual Perception, he uses psychology to understand art better. In his later book Visual Thinking (1969), Arnheim critiques the assumption that language goes before perception. For Arnheim, the only access to reality we have is through our senses. Arnheim argues that perception is strongly identified with thinking and that artistic expression is another way of reasoning. He argues that form and content are inseparable and that the patterns created by artists reveal the nature of human experience.
Arnheim was the first person who tried to apply his visual thinking and Gestalt principles to explain visual effects and meanings for Chinese characters, Chinese Yin-Yang pictures, and ancient Chinese drawings. His theory will play an important role in deciphering OBI from a biblical perspective. However, due to his research limitation in psychological areas without extension on the higher religious thinking level, his principles could not reveal the spiritual meaning behind the OBI.
 
The book Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (Booch 1993) is indeed a significant book authored by Grady Booch. It is a foundational work in the field of software engineering and object-oriented programming. The book provides comprehensive coverage of object-oriented concepts, principles, and methodologies for software analysis and design.
In this book, Grady Booch introduces readers to fundamental concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The book also delves into more advanced topics like design patterns, object modeling techniques, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
Booch's book serves as a practical guide for software engineers, architects, and developers seeking to apply object-oriented principles in their software development projects. It offers insights into best practices, methodologies, and tools for designing robust, scalable, and maintainable object-oriented systems.
Overall, this book is considered a classic text in the field of software engineering and has influenced generations of software developers and designers in their approach to building object-oriented software systems. Just as the object-oriented approach simplifies complex software from internal relationship perspectives such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, applying this approach to the study of the OBI vocabulary can help build the OBI lexicology.

Summary of Literature Review
The research on the OBI and its associated archaeological studies is abundant and broad. However, a prevailing approach in many of these studies is grounded in an atheistic, evolutionary, and indigenous standpoint. Despite a growing trend to explore the OBI through the lens of shamanism theory from a primitive human religious perspective, its core essence remains intertwined with social evolutionary perspectives. While some scholars have widened the scope by comparing the OBI to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and religion, transitioning from an indigenous perspective to a global view, these analyses often lack solid evidence and theoretical depth. Although a minority of scholars explore the OBI from a gospel perspective, their analyses often lack scientific persuasiveness, primarily due to the absence of missiological grounding. Overall, a common issue across OBI studies is the lack of a robust interdisciplinary missiological and intercultural foundation when confronted with vast data and evidence. The exploration of the OBI from a missiological and intercultural perspective in this dissertation marks a novel endeavor within academic discourse.
 
Statement of Methodology
This dissertation is within the scope of the academic intersection of the Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) study and missiology within the intercultural domain. It endeavors to hold academic significance for Chinese culture while remaining faithful to the theological tenets of the gospel. Hence, the overall research will follow the guidance of the general principles of authentic and relevant contextualization (Hesselgrave 2000, 197).
By embracing the multidisciplinary nature of missiology, this research will extensively engage with diverse academic fields, including archaeology, anthropology, history, linguistics, and theology. Distinct from other OBI research, it will integrate various methodological techniques from disparate disciplines, such as optical illusion and visual thinking theory from psychology and object-oriented analysis from computer science, to enhance its analytical capabilities and deepen its comprehension of the subject matter.
Similar to closely related studies, this research will primarily employ a combined textual and bibliographic methodology to interpret the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) from a gospel perspective. The textual analysis involves a direct examination of the OBI characters, primarily sourced from published copies of the inscriptions found on oracle bones. The bibliographic method, on the other hand, entails the collection and analysis of all relevant documents and studies across various disciplines germane to the OBI. This includes archaeological excavation reports and published images of unearthed materials, serving as primary sources for the bibliographic approach.
Personal visits to archaeological relics and historical sites can provide valuable firsthand materials and enrich personal sensational experiences, fostering independent critical thinking. Similarly, visiting museums is an effective way to gain a tangible sense of ancient cultural environments, reducing the possible misinformation in the academic field, as many of the archaeological materials discussed in the dissertation are publicly available in these institutions. It's important to note that this qualitative research does not require interviews, participant observation, or focus groups.
The textual analysis entails a thorough examination of the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) vocabulary, a primary source comprising 5,000 to 6,000 identical pictograms derived from photocopies of around 1.5 million pictorial symbols found in the OBI. The augmentation process commences with the discovery of the preexisting OBI booklet containing 31 identical pictograms. This is followed by a meticulous pictogram decoding process with multiple means, particularly including optical illusion analysis, visual thinking, structural analysis, symbolic meaning analysis, language usage, rhetorical devices, symbolism, stylistic elements, and the comparative approach.
Chinese etymological study will be employed to unveil more accurate original meanings of characters based on their historical usage. The reasons for and the significance behind the changes in the forms of Chinese characters throughout history will be explored, helping to better understand the original meaning of characters.  
The morphological analytical approach will play a key role in the textual method, involving a comprehensive study of the structure and forms of characters. This encompasses an examination of their constituent parts, including affixes (prefixes, suffixes), roots, and stems, and an exploration of how these elements combine to form meaningful units in the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI). The primary goal of the morphological analysis is to establish a hierarchical tree for roots and construct a new systematic structure for the OBI vocabulary, facilitating the index character search in the vocabulary to replace the traditional index searching by the number of the stroke or pinyin. It is unprecedented in the research that the systematic structure of the vocabulary will be used to reflect the religious purpose behind the creation of the OBI.
The bibliographic method commences with a comprehensive review of archaeological documents directly associated with the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI). These documents encompass primary firsthand archaeological sources. Secondary sources includes documents from scholars and professional studies in the field, as well as sources from local research papers or the OBI studies within amateurs or Christian communities. This examination entails analyzing various aspects, including the geographic distribution of the OBI, all unearthed materials linked to them, adjacent tombs that have been uncovered, and accompanying artifacts such as bronze vessels, pottery, and other relevant items found in concurrent contexts with the OBI. It is essential to interpret the OBI characters and their religious meanings within the whole cultural context in which each character was conceived and employed.
A distinguishing characteristic of the methodology that sets it apart from other studies in the Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) field is its deliberate avoidance of reliance on classical Chinese documents. Instead, the research prioritizes extensive archaeological investigations throughout mainland China, extending beyond the confines of the Anyang region and encompassing all ancient periods predating Christ. This strategic approach is designed to mitigate the risk of potential misinformation and avoid being misled by indigenous Chinese traditions, thus fostering independent critical thinking while upholding a historical perspective.
In line with the concept of intercultural studies, this research will also shift from an emic to an etic perspective, expanding the scope of textual and bibliographic analysis beyond the confines of Chinese culture. Specifically, the dissertation will juxtapose the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) with hieroglyphics and cuneiform texts, thereby broadening the perspective and enriching its capacity for comparative analysis. Consequently, archaeological exploration will extend to ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Canaan, and other biblical regions where the OBI may share common religious elements. Through a global intercultural comparative approach, the research seeks to illuminate the mystical facets of ancient Chinese culture by examining ancient world cultures known to contemporary scholarship. This expanded inquiry aims to decipher the enigmatic symbols within the OBI and explore their mythological dimensions from a biblical and theological perspective.
In conjunction with theories related to Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) studies, practical religious experiences utilizing the OBI will be sought through physical replications of the oracle bone inscriptions. Then, the duplicated oracle bone inscriptions will be compared with photocopies of the authentic oracle bone inscriptions, analyzing the differences and their causes. This procedure will follow the general scientific research approach, scrutinizing marks resulting from drilling, chiseling, cutting, and burning on bones, and analyzing correlations between these marks and the characters inscribed on the bones.
To bolster the validity and reliability of the research, an investigation into the universality of the gospel beyond culture and time is conducted through a theological and biblical approach. This approach ensures that the research content aligns effectively with the central research questions, thereby reducing potential personal biases and minimizing the risk of self-fulfilling prophecies (Elliston 2011, 184).

 
Chapter Breakdown
	
Introduction
This chapter is divided into five parts. The first part is a succinct description of the origin of the topic on the relationship between Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) and the gospel. The second part is the rationale and need for study in the OBI, Chinese cultural, and missiological fields. Thirdly, it is the statement of the central problem of the study, supporting research secondary questions, the research scope, delimitations, and essential terms. Then, there is a brief statement of the methodology used in the study. And finally, a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of the dissertation is given. 
Chapter I: Explore the Prophetic Relationship between the OBI and the Gospel 
In this chapter, I will investigate the relationship between the OBI and the gospel, focusing on the central research question: How can the concealed prophetic relationship between the OBI and the gospel be uncovered through intercultural and missiological perspectives, thereby testifying to the authenticity of the gospel? 
	This chapter will be divided into 7 sections. Sections 1 and 2 will focus on the secondary question: How can the mythical phenomena in Chinese history and archeology align with the supernatural religious aspects of the OBI to help reveal its prophetic connection to the gospel?
	Sections 3 to 7 will focus on the secondary question: How can exploring the origin of the OBI from intercultural and missiological perspectives help establish a foundation for understanding the prophetic relationship between the OBI and the gospel?

 
 
Chapter II: The Evidence of the Cultic Prophetic Symbolism
Based upon the preceding Chapter, this chapter will focus on historical, archaeological, and intercultural evidence that can be found to support or undermine the prophetic connection between the OBI and the gospel.
Chapter III: Missiological Significance
This chapter will discuss the connection between the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) and the gospel through missiological and intercultural lenses by examining their theological correlation within a biblical framework. It will broaden the investigation to encompass significant themes in ancient pagan cultures that foreshadow elements of the gospel before the arrival of Christ. Moreover, it will assess the universal nature of the gospel through the concept of the Son of God and examine its relevance to contemporary gospel preaching and missionary endeavors. In the end, this chapter will present a conclusion, highlighting the archaeological, historical, theological, and biblical evidence that supports the relationship between the Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBI) and the gospel, free from any Christian bias. Additionally, it will propose potential avenues for future research in this field.
