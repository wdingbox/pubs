The Bible gives principles for living that transcend culture,

The basic argument in this book is that our culture serves us well when it is the only culture in focus. In fact, it is a palace when there are no other contesting voices around us, when we can live fairly comfortable, ordered lives in the context of our own cultural system. However, when we are pushed into relationships that are outside the boundaries of our culture, that culture becomes a prison to us.


that all of us are prisoners to our culture.(p20)

we become so enamored of it that we cannot imagine any other way (p20)

As a consequence, we are blind to cultural differences and do not even think to question why people act or think differently than we do. (p20)

Its not about the knowlege its about the holy spirit. (weid)

We were raised to be proud of our culture, (p23)

My cultural identity had changed because (p24)
cultural id cann't be changed. 

They may also verbalize them in ritual and stories about the group's history. (p39)},

  abstract={Socrates of Constantinople (Greek: Σωκράτης ὁ Σχολαστικός;[1] c. 380 – after 439), also known as Socrates Scholasticus, was a 5th-century Christian church historian, a contemporary of Sozomen and Theodoret.

He is the author of a Historia Ecclesiastica ("Church History", Ἐκκλησιαστική Ἱστορία) which covers the history of late ancient Christianity during the years 305 to 439.

Editions and translations
The Historia Ecclesiastica was first edited in Greek by Robert Estienne, on the basis of Codex Regius 1443 (Paris, 1544); a translation into Latin by Johannes Christophorson (1612) is important for its variant readings. The fundamental early modern edition, however, was produced by Henricus Valesius (Henri Valois) (Paris, 1668), who used the Codex Regius, a Codex Vaticanus, and a Codex Florentinus, and also employed the indirect tradition of Theodorus Lector (Codex Leonis Alladi).

The text was edited in Patrologia Graeca vol. 67 (online at documentacatholicaomnia.eu).

The new critical edition of the text is edited by G. C. Hansen, and published in the series Die Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller (Berlin:Akademie Verlag) 1995.

An English translation by A. C. Zenos was published in Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series, Vol. 2. Edited by Philip Schaff and Henry Wallace. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1890.) (online editions: newadvent.org ccel.orgmunseys.com .

More recently (2004-2007) Socrates' History has been published in four bilingual volumes by Pierre Maraval [fr] in the Sources Chrétiennes collection.},
  annote={Chapter XVII. of the hieroglyphics found in the Temple of Serapis. 
For Christians who affirm that the cross is the sign of Christ's saving passion, claimed this character as peculiarly theirs; but the pagans alleged that it might appertain to Christ and Serapis in common; "For it symbolizes one thing to Christians and another to heathens."  While this point was controverted among them, some of the heathen converts Christianity, who were conversant with these hieroglyphic characters, interpreted the form of a cross and said that it signifies 'Life to come.'  This the Christians exultingly laid hold of, as decidedly favorable to their religion. But after other hieroglyphics had been deciphered containing a prediction that "when the cross should appear,"--for this was "life to come" -- "the Temple of Serapis would be destroyed," a very great number of the pagans  embraced Christianity, and confessing their sins, were baptized. 

Such are the reports I have heard respecting the discovery of this symbol in form of a cross. But I cannot imagine that the Egyptian priests foreknew the things concerning Christ, when they engraved the figure of a cross. For if 'the advent' of our Savior into the world 'was a mystery hid from ages and from generations' (1 Cor. 2:7-8; Eph.2:5-6; Col. 1:26; ) as the apostle declares; and if the devil himself, the prince of wickedness, know nothing of it, this minister, the Egyptian priests, are likely to have been still more ignorant of the matter;  but Providence doubtless purposed that in the enquiry concerning this character, there should something take place analogous to what happened heretofore at the preaching of Paul.  For he, made wise by the Divine Spirit, employed a similar method in relation to the Athenians, (Acts 17:23) and brought over many of them to the faith, when on reading the inscription on one of their altars, he accommodated and applied it to his own discourse. Unless indeed any one should say, that the Word of God worked in the Ehyptian priest, as it did on Balaam (Num24) and Caiaphas (John 11:51) ; for these men uttered prophecies of good things in spite of themselves. This will suffice on the subject.},

The Shang, however, did have an implicit ethos and world view. If we think metaphysics as "the practice of rationality in its most theoretical form," then it is possible for the modern historian to infer from the archaeological, artistic, and written records of the Shang. 

I choose divination, partly because it involved writing, and thus conscious and articulate intellectual activity; partly because it was one the core institutions of the Shang elite, being one of the method used to obtain consensus at the royal court; and, above all, it was the method for contacting the ultrahuman powers of the universe. If we can understand the mental assumptions underlying Shang divination, we can understand much about the Shang world view.},

Indeed, the concept of contextualization already became prominent during the Third Mandate period of 
\emph{The Theological Education Found} from 1958 to 1964. (p7) 

Contextualization differs from indigenization in that indigenization is derived from nature metaphors that concern the soil, or taking root in the soil. (p9)
however, replanting the gospel in the local soil is not the primary theological task. 

Coe wandered why Buddhism, which was also a foreign religion, had transformed itself in a local religion, while Christianity could not. 

Contextualization proposes that theology needs to be a response to the living incarnations of a living God. Theology is not revelatory, but a response to revelation.


Contextuality is the reality of wrestling with God's word in such a way that the power of incarnation, which is the divine form of contextualization, can enable people to follow in God's steps to contextualize. It is the critical assessment of the factors that make a context significant in the mission of God.(p10)

Coe makes a distinction between contextuality and contextualization. Contextuality is the critical assessment of the factors that make a context significant in the mission of God, "a missiological discernment of the signs of the times, seeing where God is at work and calling everyone to participate in it." Contextuality is the reality of wrestling with God's word in such a way the power incarnation, which is the divine form of contextualization, can enable people to follow in God's steps to contextualize. This process involves decontextualization and recontextualization, recalling the gospel imperative of death and resurrection.  (p10) 
Authentic contextuality will lead to contextualization (p10)},

  abstract={Author's Introduction:
 The key God gave us to the heart of the Sawi people was the principle of redemptive analogy--the application to local custom of spiritual truth. The principle we discerned was that God had already provided for the evangelization of these people by means of redemptive analogies in their own culture. These analogies were our stepping-stones, the secret entryway by which the gospel came into the Sawi culture and started both a spiritual and a social revolution from within. 

The people in the Sawi tribe honor treachery as the ideal. In many of the legends that the Sawi people tell to their children around the campfires, the heroes are men who formed friindships with the express purpose of later betraying the befriended one to be killed and eaten. The Sawi expression for this practice is to fatten with friendship for the slaughter.  

In recognizing that the idealization of treachery was a part of the Sawi view of life, we understood why we felt a certain culture shock. We have been sent there by God to win them, to overcome within a few short years this idealization of treachery which had been part of their way of life over centuries, possibly millenniums, of time.},

  abstract={Matthew Ricci (1552–1610). 
In 1567 a small island off the coast of China, Macao, became a Portuguese colony. For years, however, entrance to China seemed impossible. The ruling Ming dynasty had no interest in contacts with the outside world. They considered the Chinese as the givers of culture, not the receivers. Confucianism was dominant in the empire and the state; the family and ethics were governed by its ideals and teachings. 

According to one story Allessandro Valignani, a leader of the Jesuits in the Orient, looking out his window at Macao in 1579 cried out toward the Chinese coast, “Oh, Rock, Rock, when will you open?” 

Ricci’s first task was to settle in Macao to learn the Chinese language and customs—and to wait for the Rock to crack. 


but Ricci was convinced that China could never be won to the Christian faith from an outlying province. 


Ricci had tried to avoid presenting Christianity to the Chinese as something new. He refused to consider these advanced and religious people as atheists, so he taught that traditional Chinese devotion reached perfection in the Christian faith. The “Lord of Heaven,” whom the Chinese had so long revered, was God. Ricci contended that the reverence for ancestors, so common in China, was not a religious act but a social one, and therefore acceptable to Christians. 


Had adaptation gone too far? In 1631 a Franciscan and a Dominican arrived in Peking and were shocked at what they found. The word used to translate the Christian mass in the Jesuit catechism was the Chinese character for the ceremony of ancestor worship! One night the friars went in disguise to such a ceremony; they watched as Chinese Christians participated and were scandalized at what they saw. They reported their experience to Rome and the quarrel over “the rites” began. One pope approved, another disapproved, until after a century the whole mission in China fell into a serious decline. The conflict between the policy of adaptation and the policy of conquest did not end with the seventeenth century. It is raging today, only conquest is usually in terms of economic control rather than political. But the age of global expansion was special in one sense: in opening up huge areas of the earth’s surface to the Christian message it displayed some of the most innovative and creative missionary leaders found in any age.

The study of early China has been pushed into uncharted territory both by archaeology and by increasing awareness that scholars of ancient China are facing issues not entirely specific to their domain but long recognized--and struggled with-in other fields, such as Classics, Religion, Biblical Study, Near Eastern studies. etc. 

The combination of newly discovered materials with newly discovered approaches holds particularly strong potential for fresh insight into the culture of early China.},

  abstract={The title writing and authority are paired, because the latter word is commonly applied in the political, intellectual, and religious realms, and the powers of written graphs in early China lie in the intersection of these areas. The book deals primarily with Warring States period, that is, the centuries leading up to the creation of the first unified empires. (p.1)

I will sketch at least six such roles noted in Western studies (1) the use of writing as a technique of state power, primarily in the form of administrative and legal documents; (2) the creation of groups through the shared experience of reading a common body of materials; (3) the transcending of time and space; (4) the invention within texts of figures of authority, often the implicit author, who both speak to the readers and offer models for social roles; (5) the use of written graphs to create or preserve 'artificial' or 'technical' languages whose mastery distinguishes elements within a society; and (6) the treatment of written graphs as magical or sacred objects containing hidden meanings and powers. All these roles figured also in Warring States China. (p.1)

They were comprehensive in written form to large numbers of people within a delimited geographic area whose spoken tongues were not necessarily mutually comprehensible.

Finally, writing is known by all to be significant, but its significance is known only to the few. As bearers of secret meanings, texts or written graphs can become magical or religious objects that inspire reverence or fear. The connection between the silence or secrecy of writing and its authority takes several forms. First, masters of writing can appear to the illiterate as magicians. This attitude appears in the story told by Levi-Strauss in Tristes tropiques, in which the chief of the Nambikwara witnesses the anthropologist writing, and begins to make wavy lines on paper that he pretends to read. He thereby seeks to borrow for himself the magic and prestige of the outside world. Second, the secret message of writing could be conflated with celestial sings. In some cases, the gods might even communicate with men through writing. Links between divinity and hidden meanings of writing also figure in theology or any tradition based on a corpus of venerated texts. Belief in the infinite meanings of such writing leads their devotees to attribute to them hidden depths that allow for ever new interpretations. (p.3)

One version of these texts ultimately became the first state canon of imperial China, and in this capacity it served to perpetuate the dream and reality of the imperial system across the centuries. (p.4)


The so-called bureaucratic polity in China emerged from a theocratic state organized around the ancestral cult, in which writing had served to communicate with the dead and political documents and provided the content for such communications. (p.13)

The archaic background 
Devoted to communication with spirits, signs carved on ox scapulae and tortoise shells or cast into bronze vessels generated power in the Shang and Zhou state for kings and nobles who derived their ascendancy from privileged access to gods and ghosts.  (p.14) [but author consider that divination by crack bones through the application of fire was widespread across north Asia. ]  


The Zhou rulers ceased to inscribe shells or scapulae, and consequently preserved on divinatory records. However, as inscriptions cast in bronzes writing continue to link nobles to the spirit world and thereby generate political authority. 
The Shan had inscribed a few bronze vessels, ad bronze inscriptions are as ancient a form of writing as oracle bones. Nevertheless, the number of such objects increased dramatically under the Zhou, and some inscriptions became quite long. These vessels were ritual implements placed in the lineage temples of the nobility and used to make offerings to ancestors. Consequently, it seems that the intended recipients of the inscribed messages were the ancestral spirits. A minimal inscription proclaimed the casting and dedication of the vessl, while other added closing "auspicious words' that described the favorable response of the ancestors and the use of the vessel through the generations. (p16)

The characters cast in bronze, however, were not the sole form of writing used by the Zhou. Sources mention record keepers (zuo ce作册) and scribes (shi史) who wrote on perishable bamboo or wood, and as Lothar von Falkenhausen has argued, the longer bronze inscriptions probably drew on these documents. Wood and bamboo document were stored in archives for use by the living, while elements of them were reported to the ancestors through inscriptions inside sacrificial vessels. (p17)},

  abstract={Revelation in the Chinese Characters: Divine or Divined? 
Chinese Glyphomancy 

In another example, an ingenious means that the Communists used to motivate the working masses was by telling them that the character for “heaven”, tiēn , is actually composed of the two characters gōngrén , which means “worker(s)”. The implication is that there is no higher authority than the workers themselves: they are their own god. (1979, 71). The art of divining the Chinese characters is known as glyphomancy, or popularly in Mandarin as chāi-zì , meaning literally, “to dismantle the characters.” There is a wealth of literature on the subject, the earliest dating from the seventh century A.D. Glyphomancy is still widely practiced today in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. 

boat which is often cited as an example to demonstrate Chinese knowledge of Noah’s Ark in antiquity, is not one of the 10,500 characters in the Shùo Wén at all! 

Chock God’s Promise to the Chinese (1997) in which the authors analyzed the alleged biblical meaning hidden within some one hundred and fifty Chinese characters. 

The arguments that Nelson and Broadberry present are fraught with difficulties, not least of which relate to the dating of the Creation, let alone the flood. 

Other Chinese religions, such as the Taiwanese Unity Sect , use a similar approach of dissecting some Chinese characters in order to justify their beliefs (see Jordan and Overmyer 1986, 231-34). 


The linguistic fact that is a semantic-phonetic character is totally ignored. While it is true that the element correctly means vessel, the element on the right is purely a phonetic element. This phonetic element, when combined with the character for “gold” yields the character which refers to the metal “lead”. Nelson and Broadberry obviously have no use for this character, since it does not fit into the biblical story. The hieroglyphic method of reading meanings into semantic-phonetic characters can yield rather ridiculous results: the character for mother has something to do with a female horse ( “woman” “horse”). 15 


problem easily by analyzing selected characters, only those which are amenable to the biblical narrative. In other words, the Bible is taken as the authoritative text which controls the outcome of the analysis. The implication of this is clear: without the Bible, the alleged meanings in the Chinese characters remain forever hidden. 

This point is all the more crucial since there is nothing in Scripture to suggest that biblical meanings are embedded in the Chinese, or for that matter, any, language. 

This is, of course, not to say that the Chinese characters cannot be used to illustrate biblical truths. 

The atonement has made us “at-one” with God, and with each other. Sunday school teachers often teach their charges the meaning of GRACE: G od’s R iches A t C hrist’s E xpense; or of FAITH: F or A ll I 


Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission (now OMF International), is credited with the ingenious explanation of the character for “come” a man hanging on the cross with two persons (thieves) on each side! Taylor used this character as a creative graphic pun to extend an invitation to Chinese people to come to Christ. Timothy Boyle, missionary to Japan, apparently uses the Chinese characters in a similar way in his ministry. Boyle remarks, “[E]ven if the interpretation I give to a particular character does not in fact agree with the original etymology of the character (which is usually unknowable anyway), as long as it serves my purpose as a communication tool for the gospel, then I will not hesitate to use it” (1994, 15). 

It certainly gives the gospel a familiar cultural feel to the people, an important principle in contextualization. But the concept of the redemptive analogy is not an unproblematic one, for it begs the question regarding the theological validity of implanted divine revelation in any language, or culture. Is the “peace child” a deliberate piece of divinely-implanted revelation, or is it simply a cultural practice that reflects what it means to be human? The point is that since God has created humans in His image, societies all over the world have cultural resources within them to express and understand biblical truths to a good extent without presupposing these cultural elements to carry divine intention. When missionaries or evangelists, consciously or otherwise, regard cultural elements as revelatory each time they can be used to teach the truths of the gospel, they are in effect conditioning people to adopt a particular mode of thinking about faith and culture that in long run can only lead to syncretism. This is where uncompromising missiological leadership is needed, not only to develop strategies for effective ministry results but to ensure that the means of gospel proclamation are sound.

From the Back Cover
This book approaches the topic of intercultural understanding in philosophy from a phenomenological perspective. It provides a bridge between Western and Eastern philosophy through in-depth discussion of concepts and doctrines of phenomenology and ancient and contemporary Chinese philosophy. Phenomenological readings of Daoist and Buddhist philosophies are provided: the reader will find a study of theoretical and methodological issues and innovative readings of traditional Chinese and Indian philosophies from the phenomenological perspective. The author uses a descriptive rigor to avoid cultural prejudices and provides a non-Eurocentric conception and practice of philosophy. Through this East-West comparative study, a compelling criticism of a Eurocentric conception of philosophy emerges. New concepts and methods in intercultural philosophy are proposed through these chapters.  Researchers, teachers, post-graduates and students of philosophy will all find this work intriguing, and those with an interest in non-Western philosophy or phenomenology will find it particularly engaging.

It may well be true that there is a fine line between asking of and asking for, but I would suggest that it is crucially important for understanding the purpose behind Chinese divination. As several scholars of Shang oracle-bone inscriptions have argued beginning in the early 1970s, the charges of these inscriptions were phrased not as questions, but rather as state-ments. Other evidence that has come to light since then has shown clearly that Zhou divination, beginning with the Zhouyuan
 oracle-bone inscriptions of the early Western Zhou through all of the turtle-shell and milfoil divination records of the Warring States period, was not only put in the form of statements, but was explicitly  phrased as prayers. Divination in the Chinese context was only rarely a matter of questioning. Much more commonly it was an attempt to use the medium of turtle-shell or milfoil to communicate one’s intention or desire to the spirits (primarily the ancestors). It was thought that the spirits used the same medium to communicate their approval or disapproval of that intention or desire.},

Depending on or relating to the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement or idea, any message may have many contexts. Some of them are old, some are newly emerged, some may conflict each others.  
"Contextuality" means all possible contexts that could assoiciat with and influence the message.


Coe considered contextuality as the dynamic critical assessment of the factors that make a contextualization significant in the mission of God. It is the reality of wrestling with God's word in such a way that the power of incarnation, which is the divine form of contextualization, can enable people to follow in God's steps to contextualize. 
p10, MPJosephPoHoHuangandVictorHsu2018

Coe stated that contextuality and contextualization cannot be divided, though they should be distinct. This dialectic relationship between contextuality and contextualization indicates a new way of theologizing. "It involves not only words, but actions. Through this, the inherent danger of a dichotomy between theory and practice, action and reflection, the classroom and the street should be overcome." 
 [p.242]
 

Coe believed that 
only authentic contextuality leads to contextualization. Since contextuality is  dynamic, the contextualization is also a multi-dimensional dynamic process.},

[p11]


Failed to defend Christianity during the 1920s because some Chinese Christian leaders tried to demonstrate the similarities and the compatibilities of Confucianism and Christianity. [p19]

Joseph R Levenson (1965) asks this question: Once Chinese intellectuals had begun to reject their own heritage and advocate Westernization, why did not Christianity succeed a dying Confucianism? [20]

It would be difficult to find another country like China where, especially in this century, intellectuals have played such a vital role in the fate of nation and the progress of society. [41]

Many reports have indicated that there was a so-called Christianity Fever among the intellectuals after the Tiananmen Square Massacre.  For example, Cheng Ming reported that more than 8,000 students became Christian at Fuchio city in 1990 alone (Sep 1990 20) The same report also indicated that according to the estimation of the Shanghai Religious Bureau, among the twenty thousand new convert, about one-fourth are intellectuals. [57]

Press Freedom Guardian (Dec 21,1990) also described the Christianity Fever among the college students after  June fourth Massacre as an eruption of a volcano. Why? One student from Beijing University told the reporter: We do not try to find the answer from those Chinese traditional religions, because they all are established upon the presupposition that human nature is basically good. The presupposition as been proved totally false. [57]
 
the 1989 demonstration was uprededented in the history of china because of the role played by a new genre of intellectuals. [63]
the government crackdown of 1989, however, marked an irrevocable change in the once close relationship between Chinese intellectuals and the Chinese state. [63]
 
the tragedy of 1989 has  led most Chinese intellectuals to an unstable “transition state” and to become “seekers of new believe system. [64] 
 The Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 transformed them into a very ripe harvest. [64]

The past four decades have demonstrated that China's sol can nourish Christianity's seedlings. Despite chilling blasts, the roots gew a little stronger each tiem the blast subsided. They have also demonstrated that continued growth and potential flowering depend not only on the political climate, China's openness, and the development of the conomics, but also on the soverign work of God. [64]

After more a century of effort, the roots of China's church are still fragile, the atomsphere still uncertain, and . portions of the sol still infertile. [64]},

This book vividly recaptures God's universal light shown to the Chinese sage Lao Tzu 600 years before Jesus was born. By comparing Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching with the Bible, Yuan Zhiming offers a ground-breaking interpretation of Lao Tzu's Tao in light of the Word, or Logos. Yuan Zhiming juxtaposes Lao Tzu's "Holy One" with Jesus Christ, systematically and thoroughly unveiling the nature and characteristics of the mysterious Tao in a concrete and understandable manner, resolving a riddle of 2,600 years. "The text speaks to our time, because so many people believe that mere secular teaching of "morality," such as Confucius taught, is sufficient, and because what we really need is a deep spiritual awakening, such as Lao Tzu announced. The profound teaching in Lao Tzu and the Bible enriches the spirit of not only the Chinese people but also the people of the West." -Dr. Paul de Vries, president of New York Divinity School and author of The Taming of the Shrewd Lao Tzu and the Bible offers not only a spiritual feast to the analytical minds about Tao/Word/Logos, illustrating Tao in a tangible form, the Holy One/Jesus Christ, but also provides helpful advice about how to follow and be united with Tao. A work of great erudition and wisdom, it contains deep insight, opening up the secrets of the Tao while also illuminating the Bible. This book will surely delight the hearts and minds of seekers of Tao.},

THE GREAT temptation for Christians, when they speak of "Christian culture," is to let their criticism of "secular culture" become a condemnation. One cannot, of course, analyze Christian culture without critically comparing it with secular culture. The temptation to condemn the latter is natural and understandable. Sometimes the spokesmen for the secular act as if their culture were a terminal good. Sometimes they act as if their culture owed no debt to Christian sources and Christian inspirations. And sometimes, in the competition for adherents, secular culture seems to be winning the day.

But condemnation of secular culture is, for the Christian, impermissible -- on intellectual, historical, psychological and, above all, theological grounds. Grace does build on nature, and while Christian culture is, in one sense, an aggregate, a cumulative development of many energies and impulses (some of them far removed from the direct influence of grace), what makes the resulting culture "Christian" is that these energies and impulses have been and are lodged in grace-filled Christians. We can speak, then, I believe, of Christian culture as being "grace-charged." And, just as grace cannot, in Christianity that is specifically and by definition incarnational, and in a context which is by nature secular, dispense with the natural and the secular, so a grace-charged Christian culture cannot, if it is to be genuine and real, exist apart from an organic relationship with the natural and the secular.

The first value of the present collection of essays and addresses on Christian culture is precisely this negative thing: none of the contributors, so far as I can see, is guilty of what one of them, John Cogley, criticizes -- a kind of "pseudo withdrawal" from the world and a sniping at the world from some sectarian fox-hole."

If one of the marks of a mature Christian is that he is able to discern and assimilate what is good and true in the secular culture -- as Aquinas, in his day, was able to discern and assimilate what was true and good in the philosophic thought of non-Christian thinkers; if he, like Aquinas, is more delighted with the truths he finds in secular thought than he is with unmasking the errors it contains, then the contributors to the present volume must be reckoned mature Christians.

For even, as in the case of Foerster, Dawson, Donnelly and Undset, where criticism of the secular is most pointed and most cutting, the criticism does not become condemnation; no one is advocating a divorce of the Christian and the secular. One can, it is clear, speak of the "superstitious divinization of reason," or one can picture modern life being "enameled over with an arrogant gaiety," or one can describe "fate's most exquisite irony" -- today's "enlightened" leaders who scorn the "superstitions" of the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages, but who "deliberately propagate superstition in which they themselves cynically disbelieve." One can speak of these realities, as some of this volume's contributors do, and still preserve, implicitly or explicitly, the understanding that the aberrations of secularism do not justify the dismissal of the secular. One can speak of them without denying, again quoting from Mr. Cogley, that one "must establish a relevance between the natural and the supernatural, between the secular and the sacral, between the actually existing culture and Christianity.

Certainly a second mark of the mature Christian is his willingness to criticize himself and, when his culture is criticized by others, his restraint, his steady refusal to resort to invective or to pretend that anything Christian is beyond criticism. Mr. Cogley, Barbara Ward and others sustain the self-critical tradition which is indispensable to not only the maturity of the individual Christian, but to the progress and vitality of the culture itself. And this, for me, is the second great value of this book.

When Miss Ward, for example, speaks of the modern Christian's "limitation of compassion" or when she observes that today the "good Samaritan asks to see a passport before he sets to work," her indignation is that essential moral element which is inseparable from Christian culture.

And when Christopher Dawson notes that the "old domination of classical humanism has passed away," that "nothing has taken its place except the scientific specialisms which. . . tend to distintegrate into technologies," he does so, not for the sake of fox-hole sniping, but rather because he wants to underline a more fundamental point, that Christians must "realize" their "spiritual and historical identity" and},

  abstract={摘要：甲骨文中的"帝"不仅涉及商代神灵信仰,而且涉及天命上帝等哲学命题,一直是学界十分感兴趣的问题。关于"帝"字的考释也众说纷纭,莫衷一是。从天文学方面解释商周时期的信仰,是近年来西方学者常用到的方法,如艾兰等即曾经从天文星象解释"帝"字,郭静云的文章则更加形象地为甲骨文"帝"字提出了新解。郭静云《殷商的上帝信仰与"帝"字字形新解》一文认为商周时期"帝"是指自然界中,居于极高天位的崇拜对象,位居天中。如果从当前的天象看,自然界的天中必然相当于北辰。殷商时,北极天中没有可见的星星,离北极最近的一颗星即"帝"星。在帝星两侧,约相等距离的位置上有太子星(左)和庶子星(右),在北极另一侧有北斗柄上的天权、玉衡、开阳三星。如果从帝星到玉衡星、太子与天权、庶子与开阳之间也各画一条直线,则三条线的交会处,恰好正落在北极点上。在北极的左右有两颗较小的星星:右枢星和少尉星,将这两颗星连线,则与上述星星的连线构成帝字形状。在殷商时期如果要正确标示出北极的位置,可用骨、竹、树枝等简单的材料,制作一种"帝"字形的仪器,用以观察北极的仪器,这是一种既容易又不失准确的基本方法。由此推论,甲骨文中的"帝"字即由此而来。就... 更多},

  abstract={《论语》一开篇, “子曰:学而时习之, 不亦说乎?有朋自远方来, 不亦乐乎?人不知而不愠, 不亦君子乎?”要读懂《论语》, 首先就要读懂这个“子曰”。

王力主编《古代汉语》第三单元文选:“子, 男子的尊称。这里指孔子。”“子”, 在春秋时代本来是一种爵位, 只是随着历史的变迁, 朝代的更迭, “子”字也随之而降级:“诸侯——微子, 箕子;诸侯之大夫——季文子, 赵简子;士人——孔子, 孟子;乃至于——小子, 婊子” (傅斯年《与顾颉刚论古史书》) 。这样看, “子”从春秋时代的一种爵位, 变成一种对人的尊称, 已经是一种降格。

以“子曰”开头, 是一种偶然呢, 还是另有什么原因?有专家认为, 这实际上是当时社会百家争鸣竞争激烈的一种反映。王季思《玉轮轩古典文学论集》有一篇《百家争鸣和先秦诸子的文学成就》, 说:“现传的《论语》、《孟子》、《墨子》等书, 各段文章大都以‘子曰’、‘孟子曰’、‘子墨子曰’开端。子者, 老夫子也。先秦早期诸子的书, 体近语录, 因为大都是学生对老师言论的记录。”当时, “跟孔子同时聚徒讲学的还有少正卯。相传孔子门下的学生曾经三次跑到少正卯那儿去听讲, 可见双方竞争的激烈。其他各派之间的激烈竞争同样存在。后来有些学派影响逐步扩大, 实力逐渐雄厚, 内部又出现分歧, 如儒家后来分为八派, 墨家后来分为三派。为了证明自己的货色是真正的‘张小泉’、‘王麻子’, 各派的学者各自把老师的言论记录下来。”为什么要用“子曰”开头呢?分析起来, 恐怕主要是当时的一种客观需要。用“子曰”, 可以证明货真价实。

“子曰”体现着一种创造, 不是无中生有, 随意杜撰。这个“子曰”, 当然就是生活中活生生的孔子, 就是他的一言一行一举一动。既有他的哲言嘉行, 也有他的辛酸和无奈。比如《雍也》:“子见南子, 子路不说。夫子矢之曰:‘予所否者, 天厌之!天厌之!’”这是一个赌咒发誓的孔子;又如《阳货》:“佛肸召, 子欲往。子路曰:‘昔者由也闻诸夫子曰:亲于其身为不善者, 君子不入也。佛肸以中牟畔, 子之往也, 如之何!’子曰:‘然。有是言也。不曰坚乎, 磨而不磷;不曰白乎, 涅而不缁。吾岂匏瓜也哉?焉能系而不食?’”这又是一个急于谋生的孔子。这些“子曰”, 都是真实的孔子。一句话, 实事求是。既不夸大, 也不缩小;既不掩瞒, 也不粉饰。这就不是“高大全”。把一个人过五关斩六将的光辉一面和失荆州走麦城的真实一面, 同时展现在他的文集里。

“子曰”体现着一种平等, 不是至高无上, 独此一家。有“子曰”, 当然就可以有非“子曰”。事实上, 《论语》里除了“子曰”, 还有“曾子曰”、“有子曰”等等。金克木《探古新痕》有一篇《〈论语〉“子曰”析》, 说:“‘子曰’, 大家都说是‘夫子曰’, 即‘孔子说’。但是书中还有‘孔子曰’十一处, ‘有子曰’四处, ‘曾子曰’十三处, ‘子夏曰’九处, ‘子贡曰’六处, ‘子游曰’三处, ‘子张曰’二处, 其余才都是‘子曰’。这些需要分别对待。”此外确实还有许多学生说的一些有时恭敬、有时并不恭敬的话。比如《先进》:“子路使子羔为费宰。子曰:‘贼夫人之子。’子路曰:‘有民人焉, 有社稷焉。何必读书, 然后为学?’子曰:‘是故恶夫佞者。’”这里就表明了子路对读书的看法, 与孔子认识并不一致;又如《子路》:“樊迟请学稼, 子曰:‘吾不如老农。’请学为圃。曰:‘吾不如老圃。’樊迟出。子曰:‘小人哉, 樊须也!上好礼, 则民莫敢不敬;上好义, 则民莫敢不服;上好信, 则民莫敢不用情。夫如是, 则四方之民襁负其子而至矣, 焉用稼?’”这里就记录下学生中有人愿意学农的事实, 孔子虽然不赞成, 也只是在背后发一通议论, 当面却不得不坦率承认自己“不如老农”和“不如老圃”。这就不是“家长制”。把学生说的话和老师说的话, 不分尊卑长幼放在一本文集里一起编排, 在中国历史上, 也没有看到过第二例。

“子曰”体现着一种尊重, 不是唯我独尊, 舆论一律。有“子曰”, 当然生活中就有可能出现批评“子曰”的话。事实上, 《论语》里除了“子曰”而外, 确实还有当时许多人 (主要是一些普通老百姓) 对“子曰”的批评甚至嘲讽。比如《微子》:“子路从而后, 遇丈人, 以杖荷莜。子路问曰:‘子见夫子乎?’丈人曰:‘四体不勤, 五谷不分。孰为夫子?’”这就直截了当批评他“四体不勤, 五谷不分”, 愧对“夫子”称号了。这就不是“一言堂”所能容忍的。把普通人的批评甚至嘲讽编进文集, 让这些批评和嘲讽与文集一起流传, 在中国历史上, 除了鲁迅的杂文集有这种类似的编排方式, 其余似乎也并不多见。

“子曰”后来变成了一种武器, 一种申明自己主张的思想武器。丁守和《谔谔集》有一篇《抗战中的文化教育精神》:“知识分子作为士, 是人文价值的守望者, 只讲是非;而如果作为仕, 则要考虑利害。从比干到伍子胥, 知识分子都企求以道统压王统, 在历代大臣的奏议中, 充斥‘子曰’、‘书曰’、‘传曰’、‘先王曰’。中国知识分子不同于一般的专家, 他们最富于人文精神。孔子曰:‘三军可夺帅也, 匹夫不可夺志也。’”这一点, 往往为那些一见“子曰”就觉得头疼的人士所忽视。而这种有意无意的忽视, 恰恰把“子曰”的积极意义一笔抹煞去了。},

1.  “Son of God” as a Christological Title
2.  “Son of God” in Select Passages
3.  “Jesus the Son of God” in Christian and Muslim Contexts

Although it is a foundational confession for all Christians, much of the theological significance of Jesus’s identity as “the Son of God” is often overlooked or misunderstood. Moreover, this Christological concept stands at the center of today’s Bible translation debates and increased ministry efforts to Muslims. New Testament scholar D. A. Carson sheds light on this important issue with his usual exegetical clarity and theological insight, first by broadly surveying Jesus’s biblical name as “the Son of God," and then by focusing on two key texts that speak of Christ’s sonship. The book concludes with the implications of Jesus’s divine sonship for how modern Christians think and speak about Christ, especially in relation to Bible translation and missionary engagement with Muslims across the globe.

“No christological designation is as essential as ‘Son of God’; none is more important. This study makes that impressively clear by sound and careful exegesis and theological reflection in the face of misunderstandings and disputes, past and current. Once again, D. A. Carson serves the church well.”

“What does it mean for us to confess that Jesus is the Son of God? D. A. Carson tackles this question in Jesus the Son of God. In this little book he lays a firm foundation to help the church understand ‘Son of God’ with reference to Jesus. After considering uses of ‘Son of God’ in Scripture, both in general and when applied to Jesus, Carson models the way systematic theology should be based on solid biblical exegesis. Carson is especially concerned to bring his study to bear on the controverted issue in missiological circles concerning how to present Jesus as Son of God in Christian and Muslim contexts. Here he critically, but kindly, calls for rethinking new translations that have replaced references to God the Father and Jesus as his Son to make them more acceptable to Muslims.},
