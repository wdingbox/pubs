            "p1": `THere are no peoples however primitive without religion and magic. Nore are there, it must be added at once, any savage races lacking either in the scientific attitude or in science. In every primitive communitym studied by trustworthy and competent observers, there have been found two clearly distinguishable domains, the Sacred and the Profane; in other words, the domain of Magic and Religion and that of Science.
            On the one hand there are the traditional acts and observances, regarded by natives as sacred, carried out with reverence and awe, hedged around with prohibitions and special rules of behavior. Such acts and observances are always associated with beliefs in supernatural forces, especially those of magicm or with ideas about beingsm spirits, ghosts, dead ancestors or gods.

            On the other hand, a moment's reflection is sufficient to show that no art or craft however primitive could have been invented or maintained, no organized form of hunting, fishing, tilling, or search for good could be carried out without the careful observation of natural process and a firm believe in its regularity, without the power of reasoning and without confidence in the power of reason; that is, without rudiments of science.

            The sessnce of primitive religion is animism, the belief in spiritual beings, and he shows how this belief has originated in a mistaken but consistent interpretation of dreams, visions, hallucinations, cataleptic states and similar phenomena. 
            
            `,
            "p8":` One achievement of modern anthropology we shall not question: the recognition that magic and religion are not merely a doctrine or a philosophy, not merely an intellectual body of opinion, but a a special mode of behavior, a progmatic attidude build up reason, feelings, and will alike. It is a mode of action as well as a system of belief, and a socialogical phenomenon as well as a personal experience. But with all this, the exact relation between the social and the indiviciual contributions to religion is not clear, as we have seen from the exaggerations committed on either side. Not is it clear what are the respective shares of motions and reason. All these questions will be possible only to suggest solutions and indicate lines of argument in this short essay `

            Prophecies or predictions? The best approach to a possible supernatural phenomenon is a simple one. We exercise a careful skepticim, and we always look for the natural explanation first. We dont exluce the possiblity of the superatural, but a reasonable method means we look for the ordinary anser before we propose a supernatural cause.

            This priciple applies to prophecy as it does to more unusuall superjatura phenomena. We admit that unexplained insights into the future might occur. A person with an unusuall psychic gift might be able to glimpse the furtre, and God might enlighten a person to see the future through dreams, visionsm or inner locutions. First, however, we should consider the more prosaic possibility that the visionary is decluded, emotionally unstable, or memtally ill. While we admit that prophesying the future is possible, we exercise common sense and suggest that what many believbe are prophecies may simply be predictions.

            With hinsignt, it is easy to see prophecies as supernatural glimpses into the future. If a prophecy has 'come true', it is tempting to read into it a supernatural power to foretell the future--tempting, but usually not necessary. So, for example, in Math24:1-8, Jesus forcast the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. It would seem that Jesus had supernatural foresight. 

            He could well have had supernatural foresight, but that was not required to forecast disaster for the Jews.
