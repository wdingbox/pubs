        "abstract": "My daughter studies in medical in Northwest Univ.  She received many admission letters, including Columbia Univ., Cambridge, etc. But she choose the best fittingness. \n\nIf she got Dr. degree she can survive anywhere. \n\nI hope my daughter had second child otherwise I would not come to visit her. \n\nToday, Chinese children had no fun. They study and study.\n\nWe have Wechat group, welcome to join.  we can help each other.\n\n\nI recalled my English teacher John who wanted to teach English in Gansu. But he was driven out of China.\n\nThousands of Chinese live in usa, but no American could live in China."

        "abstract": "中国人的品质基本集中了自私，贪婪，嫉妒，胆小，奴性和仇恨于一身。﻿\n\n中国人的问题，不单纯是中共带来的，更多的是中国文化带来的，这是一个腐朽落寞的与现代文明格格不入的文化。刘晓波所说的300年殖民才可能改变中国人一点不过分。香港100年殖民其实骨子里还是中国人那些东西；台湾人几十年民主政治也依然满身的中国人的陋习；而大陆人已经完全演变成怪物。中国人的品质基本集中了自私，贪婪，嫉妒，胆小，奴性和仇恨于一身。\n\n西方传教士当年说：中国自古盛产四物：暴君奴才假货谎言﻿\n\n五千年发霉的文化！这句话精辟"
