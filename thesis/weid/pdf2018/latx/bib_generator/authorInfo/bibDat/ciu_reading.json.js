This was one of the questions that first got me started on the journey that has resulted in the interpretation of Genesis 1 presented in this book. It was not the function orientation found in the ancient Near Eastern literature that changed my way of thinking about Genesis 1— it was the text of Genesis 1. The whole process begins with verse 5, the concluding verse of the account of day one: God called the light “day” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening and there was morning— the first day. (niv) First of all it should be observed that light is never treated as a material object in the ancient Near East, despite our modern physics. It is rather thought of as a condition, just as darkness is. So even if light were being created, one would not be able to make the claim that this is a material act. In fact, however, light itself is not the focus of this day’s activities. What is the text talking about\nWalton, John H..

After all, that is not what light is. The solution is not difficult to find. Some would even consider it transparent and hardly worth even noticing. If something connected with light is named “day” we can deduce that it is not light itself, but the period of light, for that is what “day” is. Since “day” is a period of light, and “day” is the name given, we conclude that we are dealing with a rhetorical device called metonymy in which a noun can reasonably be extended to a related concept. 1 In this case then, the author intends for us to understand the word “light” to mean a period of light. Otherwise the verse would not make sense. As a result, “God called the period of light ‘day’ and the period of darkness he called ‘night.’” 2 With this information from verse 5, we can now proceed backward through the text to verse 4. There we are told that “God separated the light from the darkness.” Again we note that this statement does not make any sense if light and/or darkness are viewed as material objects. They cannot logically be separated, because by definition they cannot exist together in any meaningful scientific or material way. The solution of verse 5 works equally well here as the verse takes on its obvious meaning with God separating the period of light from the period of darkness. These are the distinct periods that are then named day and night in verse 5. So far so good. Now comes the clincher. If “light” refers to a period of light in verse 5 and in verse 4, consistency demands that we extend the same understanding to verse 3, and here is where the “aha!” moment occurs. We are compelled by the demands of verses 4 and 5 to translate verse 3 as “God said, ‘Let there be a period of light.’ ” If we had previously been inclined to treat this as an act of material creation, we can no longer sustain that opinion. For since what is called into existence is a period of light that is distinguished from a period of darkness and that is named “day,” we must inevi-\nWalton, John H..

The basis for time is the invariable alteration between periods of light and periods of darkness. This is a creative act, but it is creation in a functional sense, not a material one. This interpretation solves the long-standing conundrum of why evening is named before morning. There had been darkness in the precreation condition. When God called forth a period of light and distinguished it from this period of darkness, the “time” system that was set up required transitions between these two established periods. Since the period of light had been called forth, the first transition was evening (into the period of darkness) and the second was morning (into the period of light). Thus the great cycle of time was put in place by the Creator. As his first act he mixed time into the features of the cosmos that would serve the needs of the human beings he was going to place in its midst. A second conundrum that this resolves is the detail that many have found baffling over the ages as they ask, How could there be light on day one when the sun is not created until day four? Two observations can now be made: First, this is less of a problem when we are dealing with “time” in day one rather than specifically with “light.” But this does not really resolve the problem without the second observation: If creation is understood in functional terms, the order of events concerns functional issues, not material ones. Time is much more important than the sun— in fact, the sun is not a function, it only has functions. It is a mere functionary. More about this in the next chapter.\nWalton, John H..

        "abstract": "(p.3) 1.2 Intertextuality \nIntertextuality is an observation of relationships between texts that places the generation of meaning in the dynamic conversation between text/intertext/reader. 7 What follows are a few points outlining an understanding of intertextuality. \n\nFirst, intertextuality was a product of the cultural and political upheaval in France in the 1960's. Julia Kristeva, most often identified as the originator of intertextuality, 8 her teacher, Roland Barthes, and other post-structuralists, attempted to intellectually subvert what they perceived to be the bourgeois, elitist power structures of their context by reexamining some of the basic elements of culture, the understanding of ‘text’ being one such element. Intertextua lity at its inception was not an isolated or neutral intellectual observation, but ‘a means of ideolog i- cal and cultural expression and of social trans formation.’ 9 It was a tool\nof revolution. This said, there are those who would like to discredit the observation of intertextuality because of its beginnings (the Marxist, Maoist, Freudian, and generally subversive and revolutionary influences on Kristeva's thought). 10 Acknowledging the context and motivation of its genesis, intertextuality is larger than its beginnings and continues to be a useful concept within semiotics, text linguistics, philosophy, and biblical studies. As such, intertextuality appears to be here to stay... at least for some time.\n\nSecond, intertextuality at its heart is an understanding of text. Given a dialogical or conversational understanding of text/intertext, the question of what a text is broadens ad infinitum to include, not merely written texts, but history, culture, art, etc. Life becomes the model for text. 12 As lives lived are inevitably lived in conversation with the other, 13 so texts participate in a dialogical existence with the other (intertext/reader/context) in the reading of the reader. Human existence at its very nature is in dialogue with the world around it. 14 As dialogue is at the heart of human existence, similarily it is at the heart of text.\n\nAlso along these lines, within the discussion of intertextuality the boundaries of text are always questionable, always permeable. In a\nGiere, S. D.. A New Glimpse of Day One : Intertextuality, History of Interpretation, and Genesis 1. 1-5, De Gruyter, Inc., 2009. ProQuest Ebook Central, http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ciu/detail.action?docID=511869.\nCreated from ciu on 2019-10-23 09:41:55.\n\nFinally, at its core intertextuality is an observation not a method. It is an observation of the nature of text and of the relationship of text/intertext/reader. While intertextuality is a fuzzy concept, maybe intentionally so, in its purest form it cannot be a methodology. Critiques of the improper methodization of intertextuality come from Hatina, 23 Aichele and Phillips, 24 van Wolde, 25 and Beal, 26 noting especially the confusion of ‘agency’ , ‘influence’, and ‘allusion‘ for intertextuality among contemporary biblical scholars. Rather, intertextuality is an observation of a broad notion of ‘text’ and the integral role of the reader/reading community in the production of meaning. To summarize, the study of intertextuality leads down a plethora of winding paths of complex relationships and multi-layer conversations between texts/intertext/reader. All the while, texts are in conversation with other texts/intertexts, loosely comprising an intertextual mosaic (referred to as a ‘tapestry’ in this study) extending ad infinitum into a blurry horizon, portions of which are picked up and digested by the reader in the creation of meaning. Meaning happens in the conversation of text/intertext/reader, the confluence of a broad understanding of text that includes culture, history, art, etc., and the reader’s varied aw areness of the text's intertextuality.\nGiere, S.

The final intertextual marker comes in the numbering or ordering of the days that completes each of the first six days of creation, which in this case is  . This declaration that both separates the first act of creation from the rest and includes it within the seven-day framework serves as a natural full-stop to the first day. With the separation and naming of day and night,  can conclude with the formula that will indicate the conclusion of all of the first six days.\nGiere, S. D..

        "abstract": "The foundation for Godly Relationships: The Mutuality within the Trinitarian God. \nGod is characterized by the supposedly “male” traits surrounding designations such as “lord” and “King.” This characterization has tended to lead to a conception of human relationships that gives prominence to the male and foster a hierarchy of male over female. According this model, men represent God whereas women symbolize creation. \nThe eternal God is not an undifferentiated reality. The one God is the social Trinity, the fellowship of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Consequently, God is fundamentally relational. Hence it comes as no surprise that when God fashions the pinnacle of creation, a unity-in-diversity—humankind as male and female—emerges. \nThe plural divine reference means that the biblical writer was somehow a crypto-trinitarian. The plurality of humankind as male and female is internally a plurality. The mutuality is evidenced in what provides the best window into the divine dynamic, namely, Jesus’ relationship to the one he called “Abba” or Father. \n\nOn the basis of this ancient Christian assertion, some theologians construct a linear or asymmetrical model of the Trinity, in which authority flows from the Father to the Son (and finally to the Spirit). This linear conception, in turn, provides the transcendent foundation for an asymmetrical model of human relationships. These thinkers claim that just as authority flows from the Father to the Son, so also men have authority over women, and whatever authority women have derided from men. \nSuch a conclusion, however, fails to see that the dynamic Origen referred to as “the eternal generation of the Son” moves in two directions. As the church father Athanasius realized, not only does this dynamic generate the Son, it also constitutes the Father. In that the Son is none other than the eternal Son of the eternal Father, the Son is not the son without the Father. But in the same way, the Father—being the eternal Father of the eternal Son—is not the Father without the Son.\nOf course, this illustration has an obvious short-coming and therefore ought not to be pushed too far. Human generation is temporal; it always happens at a point in time. Not so with God, the ancient theologians declared. The generation of the Son—the act which constitutes the Father as Father—is an eternal dynamic, so that the Father never was apart from the Son. \nDespite the limitations of the analogy, the point ought to be clear. The idea of generation within the triune God means that we must balance the subordination of the Son to be Father with dependence of the Father on the Son. In short, the eternal generation of the Son indicates that the First and Second Persons of the Trinity enjoy a mutuality of relationship. In a certain sense, each is dependent on the other for his own identity. \n\nIn sending to the Son into the world, the Father entrusted to the Son the entire divine program, which focus on the establishment of God’s reign and hence sets forth the Father’s own deity. \nConsideration such as these suggest that we cannot appeal to the example of Christ’s subordination to the Father alone and hence an asymmetrical model of God as definitive for male-female relationships. Rather, the foundation for godly human relationships lies in the subordination of the Son to the Father together with the dependency of the Father on the Son. The application this transcendent mutuality within the divine dynamic to the human sphere leads quite naturally to an emphasis on the interdependency of, and mutuality between male and female. \nThe Goal of Male-Female relationships: Reflecting the Very Character of God.\nThe phrase, “in our image”, indicates the goal of the creation of humankind. God intends that humans be the imago dei. But how are we the image of God? and are men and women equally the bearers of the divine image?\nIn contrast to statements such as these, egalitarian thinkers affirm unequivocally that both male and female are fully the image of God. They see clear indication of this in the first creation story, in that God gave to both sexes the responsibility of multiplying and subduing the earth. Or stating this in Reformed theological terms, the Creator charged humankind—male and female—with the “cultural mandate.” \nI would argue that the image of God is primarily a relational concept. Ultimately we do not reflect God’s image on our own but in relationship. Thus, the imago dei is not primarily what we are as individuals. Rather it is present among humans-in-relationship. In a word, the image of God is found in human “community.”\n\nThe creation narrative themselves point to the communal nature of the divine image. Implicit in the first but more explicit in the second creation narrative is the idea that God makes the first human pair so that humans may enjoy community with each other. More specifically, the creation of the woman is designed to deliver the man from his isolation. The narrative indicates that Adam’s solitude arose from a void that could not be filled by his companionship with the animals nor, interestingly enough, even by the presence of the solitary Adam before God. The appropriate antidote for this situation was the creation not merely of a human counterpart but more specifically of a female counterpart. (p6)\nMarriage is a reminder of God as the One who loves. More specifically, it presents the exclusive nature of the divine love. (p8) Marriage can be a metaphor of the divine love. The narrator presents marriage as the joining of two persons who share a fundamental sameness as “flesh of one flesh” and yet differ from each other as male and female. This human dynamic reminds us of the dynamic within the triune God. As we noted earlier, the divine life entails the relationship between First and Second Persons who share the same divine essense but are nevertheless differentiated from each other. The bond uniting them is the divine love, the third trinitarian person, the Holy Spirit. As marriage incorporates its divinely-given design to be the intimate, permanent bond arising out of the interplay of sameness and difference this human relationship reflects the exclusive relationship of love found within the Trinity, the unique relationship between the Father and the Son concretized in the Holy Spirit. \nNot only does marriage represent the relationality within the eternal divine life, it also reflects God’s great love for creation. Here again, marriage speaks of the holiness or exclusiveity of the divine love, As is indicated by the OT prophets and reiterated in Eph 5, marriage is a fitting picture of the kind of relationship God desired to share with God’s people. The marriage bond—i.e., shared love—binds together a specific man and a specific woman in an exclusive relationship that each of them is to honor. In a similar manner, God’s love for us creates a bond that is exclusive and holy. God desires that we honour no other gods and that our relationship to God be threatened by no rival loyalties. (p8)\nUnderstanding the metaphorical significance of their marriage ought to motivate each couple to live out in the various dimensions of their life together God’s desire that their relationship be an ongoing witness to the character of the eternal God and an appropriate picture of the glorious connection that binds Christ and the church. As this occurs, their marriage can become godly relationship between this man and this woman, which brings honour and glory to God. (p8)\n \nThe means to Godly Relationships: Empowering the Other.\n\n“He will rule over you” (Gen 3:16) is not a prescription of what is morally necessary for godly relationships, but a description of life after the Fall.

        "publisher": "Inter-Varsity Press",
        "year": "2017",
        "abstract": "Rarely addressed throughout church history, the doctrine of adoption has seen fresh attention in recent years. Although valuable, contemporary studies have focused primarily on etymological, cultural, and pastoral considerations, giving little to no attention to vital systematic theological concerns. In this groundbreaking work, Professor David Garner examines the function of adoption in Pauline thought: its relationship to the doctrines of Christ, the Holy Spirit, eschatology, and union with Christ, as well as its primary place among the other benefits of salvation. Adoption frames Pauline soteriology, Garner argues, and defines the Trinitarian, familial context of redemption in Christ, the Son of God. Properly understood, adoption's paradigm-shifting implications extend deep and far. Endorsed by Joel R. Beeke, Dan Cruver, Richard B. Gaffin Jr., Howard Griffith, Nancy Guthrie, Russell Moore, Harry L. Reeder, and Guy Prentiss Waters.",
