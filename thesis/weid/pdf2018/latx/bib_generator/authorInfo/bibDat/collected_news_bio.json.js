        "p1:The imposition of Western theology in Asia":"Theological ideas are created on the Continent (Europe), corrected in Great Britain, corrupted in America, and crammed into Asia,’ said one theologian. In Asia there are approximately 1,000 theological institutions including Bible schools, the majority of them established by Western missionaries. Since 1945 thousands of Asian students have gone to the West for their graduate theological education and many of these returning to Asia have introduced Western theologies at different theological schools throughout Asia.",
        "p2":"Nevertheless, because of rising nationalism and the reassertion of traditional values in Asia since the end of World War II, Asian theologians have been seeking liberation from Western theologies in order to make the gospel more relevant to their own life situations.",
        "":"",
        "syncretism":"The Unknown Christ of Hinduism (1964),stressed that Christ already dwells in the heart of a Hindu and that the mission of the church is not to bring Christ to the Hindu but to bring Christ out of him.",
        "Accommodation theology":"Just as a hotel or a family accommodates a guest, so theological accommodation considers prevailing customs and religious practices of another culture and accommodates good ideas from other religions.",
        "Situational theology":"This situational theology may not be in agreement with the biblical and historical doctrines of the Christian church but speaks to concrete situations in Asia. Dr Kazoh Kitamori’s Pain of God Theology in Japan is an excellent illustration. He tried to demonstrate to the suffering people in Japan after their defeat in World War II that the God revealed in the Bible is the God of suffering and pain who could identify with the suffering Japanese.",
        "Liberation Theology":"focusing on human rights, poverty, injustice and nuclear war.",
        "The Minjung (Masses of People) Theology":"is a form of situational theology in South Korea developed to deal with socio-political issues in the country. The present religious situation in South Korea cannot be fully understood apart from the impact of the Minjung Theology. The Minjung Theology as a Korean version of liberation theology takes into consideration the cries and groans of the suffering people known as ‘han’, because the Minjung (masses of People) are politically oppressed and powerless and economically exploited.",
        "Biblically oriented Asian theology":"Declaration warned of the danger of syncretism and universalism in Asian theology. It encouraged Asian theologians to give careful thought concerning contextualization and Asian theology, and circumscribed the area for evangelical theologians where they could exercise contextualization. Evangelical theologians have a set of presuppositions in their faith such as the inerrancy of the Scriptures, the uniqueness of Christ, substitutionary atonement and missiological objectives in theology, etc., which set a basis for making the gospel relevant in each culture."

This is a power of perception and insight that can grasp the meaning under the surface of things and phenomena. Dr. Choan-seng applies the Buddhist term 'third-eye' to this king of in insight. He criticizes the western way of doing theology as 'two-dimensional theology' and suggests that one must do theology with a third eye. The third eye theology is to see Christ through perspectives other than the western eyes, such as Chinese, Japanese, Asia, African and Latin Americans eyes.",
        "abs2":"Dr. Son is Taiwanese theologian who has suffered in his time, not only from the tragic history of China, but also from the whole difficulties of contemporary Asia. He consequenctly starts his theology from the God who suffers. This God is a God with a heartache, a God who responds to the fear and predicament of human community. He is a relational God who stands apart from the world. At least two Aisan elements can be found in this concept of God's heartache. First, it corresponds to the heart-mind's structure of Chinese Neo-confucianist tradtion which puts Hin-hsing (heart-mind-nature) as the ultimate ground of life and the world. Similarly, the third-eye theology begins with the problem of the loss and recovery of the human heart, and formulates its insight from the heart to heart communication between man and God. The pain-love of the heart of God reaches out to the whole personality of the human mind. Secondly, 'relationship' is the primary category of both the Buddhist and Confucianst way in understanding the world. Third-eye tehology emphasizes the God who painfully search for an interrelationship with human beings. Through suffering the heart of God and hearts of humans can be connected."

He gives you a verse from the Bible because you are in the similar situation to the one in which He first said that. Therefore, if God gives you a verse of Scripture, you need always go and read the chapter in which that verse occurs. Because He is not giving you those words just out of the blue."
