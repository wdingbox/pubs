            "intro":"The expression 'Son of Man', used in the Gospels almost exclusively by Jesus, has been the object of intensive study since the Protestant Reformation, yet scholars have come to no agreement on its origin or meaning. Research in this area has been described as 'a veritable mine field' and 'a can of worms'. Because of the scope and complexity of the literature, no comprehensive survey of the subject has been written in the twentieth century. Delbert Burkett's book fills this need. It provides a comprehensive historical overview of the debate from the patristic period to 1996, and gives an evaluation of that research and a summation of the present state of the question. Burkett concludes that despite nineteen centuries of 'Son of Man' study there is no consensus concerning the meaning or origin of the expression; the debate is therefore a prime example of the limits of New Testament scholarship.",

            "loc51:skepticism_gen":"Today scholarship can no longer take for granted that Jesus actually used this expressiion in the way the Gospel describe. We know know that the Gospels often attribute to Jesus ideas and sayings that actually originated at t a later time, in the life of the early Christian church. Even if Jesus did not use the expression, however, it remains important for understanding the origins of christology. Its frequent occurence in the Gospel tradition shows that it represented an important strand of thought in the early Chrsitian community. If it does not tell us about Jesus himself, it does tell us what the earliest Christian believed about Him",

            "loc51":"But what exatctly does it tell us? This is the problem. The Gospels never explain the phrase, and though it has been the object of intensive study since the Protestan Reformation, scholars have come to no agreement on even the most basic questions concerning it. ",

            "loc51_or_p2":"What does it mean? Where does it come fromm? To whom does it refer? Is it a title or not? Does it tell us something about Jesus or about the faith of the early church?",

            "p1": "The greek expression, 'the son of man', plays a key role in the christology of all four canonical Gospels. While it appears in about fifty different sayings in the NT, all but one of these occurs in the Gospels. There expression almost always occurs on the lips of Jesus. Since Jesus always speaks of the Son of Man in the third person, one could infer that he is referring to someone other than himself. ",
            
            "p1a":"This expression has been a central issue in NT studyies since the beginning of modern scholarshp. Because it is used almost exclusively by Jesus, many scholars have seen it as key to Jesus's own self-consciousness.",

            "p1b":"In the nineteen century, for example, H.J. Holtmann affirmed, 'nothing can be more certain than that He himself chose it as the most apt ... to designate what was typical of his personal nature, what was characteristic of his appearance and calling. Therein is contained the entire importance of the name'(H.Holtzmann 1865:213) ",

            "p2":"What does it mean? Where does it come fromm? To whom does it refer? Is it a title or not? Does it tell us something about Jesus or about the faith of the early church?",

            "p2a":"In 1996, Alberrt Schweitzer asserted, 'Broadly speaking .. the son-of-man problem is both historically sovable and has been sovled'(Schweitzer[1906]1968:283) ",

            "p3":"[Previous surveys of research:] Early surveyys of opinion on the 'Son of Man' problem appeared in commentaries, usually at the Mat8:20, where the term first occurs in the NT.(e.g. Wolf 1725; Kocher 1766) ",

            "p3a":"[Overview of the debate] Ab brief overview of the 'Son of Man'. The earliest interpretations of the expression were based on the Greek form of the phrase and took 'son' in a lieral, genealogical sense. Both patristic authors and Gnostics understood the phrase to identify Jesus as the son of some particular parent, such as Mary, Adam, or the Gnostic god Anthropes. This type of interpretation prevailed through the Middle Ages.",

            "p3b":"With the flourishing of Semitic studies after the Reformation, interpreters sought to identify the Semitic phrase the underlay the 'Son of Man'......",

            "p6":"Early orthodox writers interpreted the phrase as 'the of the human,' identifying 'the human' as Mary or Adam. After the Reformation, a few interpreters indentifed 'the human' as Joseph.",

            "p6":"[The fons Anthrops] In certain Gnostic ets, 'Anthropos'('Man') was the name of an 'aeon' or god.  This designation apparently develped from speculation on Gen1:26: if 'man' is made in the image of God, then God must in some sense be a primal 'Man'. In various Gnostic writings, a second god emanated from this first Man. This second god is identified as Christ and designated 'son of Man', i.e. son of the god Anthropos. Thus the Gnostics took 'Son' in a genealocial sense, identifying 'Man' as a god rather than a human being.",

            "p7":"[The son of the human] when patristic interpreters sought to explain 'son of (the) man', more explicitly, they took 'son' in a genealogical sense and 'the man' or 'the huamn' as a reference to a particular person.  ",

            "p8":"[The Son of Mary]Irenaeus stated, So he, the Son of God our Lord, being the Word of the Father, is also son of a human, because he had his human generation from Maryy -- who descended from humans and who was herself a human -- thus becoming the son of a human.(Adv Haer.3.19.3) ",

            "p10":"[weid]Female represent the clone from man, distinguish it. Jesus cannot be female, because Jesus derived from God.",

            "loc97":"Yet nineteen centuriees of 'Son of Man' study have led to no consensus concerning the meaning or origin of the expression. The 'Son of Man' debate thus serves as a prime illustration of the limits of NT scholarship.",

            "loc106":"The earliest interpreters of huios tos anthropos in a literal genealogical sense: for them it identified Jesus as the son of some particular parent. On the one hand, Gnostics interpreted the phrase as the 'son of Anthropoos', Anthrops being a Gnostic god. On the other hand, early orthodx writers interpreted the phrrase as 'the son of the human,' identifying 'the human' as Mary or Adam. After the Reformation, a few interpreters indentified 'the human' as Joseph. ",

            "loc151":"[Evaluation] These genialogical interpretations have been justly criticized. If the expression meant 'son of the human' indication descent from Mary, Joseph or Adam, why would Jesus so frequently emphasize that he was born of a human being when none of his beares had any doubt of this",

            "loc152":"The earliest interpreters, who spoke Greek as their native language, unanimously saw in the Greek phrase a filial relation between a son and a parent. What these interpreters did not recognize was the possibility that a Semitic expression underlay the Greek. As we shall see, it was this recogniation more than anything else that caused the genealoogical interrpretation to fall out of favor. ",

            "loc169":" 'the Son Man' might emphasize that which he had in ommon with humanity, wither human nature or human nature in its lowliness and weakness. On the other hand, the definite article before the phrrase might point to Jesus as the Son of Man par excellence, emphasizing that which set him apart as an extraordinary human being. These different possibilites fave rise to three varieties of interpretation: the Son of Man as the simply human, the lowly human, or the superior(ideal) human. ",

            "loc1063":"[Evaluation]The nontitular interpretation of 'Son of Man' in the Gospels has been around now for about 450 years. Various theories belongint to this class have a certain appeal....... The basic problem with the circumlocutional theory was: the idiom requires a demonstrative pronoum ('this man') which the Gospel expression lacks. As for the generic/indefinit interpretation, its chief weakness in all of its forms lies in the fact that it produces implausible results for all but a few of the Son of Man saying in the Gospels. Only one saying certainly reflects a generic bar enasha that hase been translated onverliterally as τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (Luk12:10, Matt 12:32). While a generic interpretation of 'son of man' has also been found plausible by numerous scholars in Mark 2.10 and 2.28 ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (Mark2:10)",

Exegetical work supported by literature research shows that the creation days consist of six ordinary 24-hour periods, each covering a night and a day. The universe was created ex nihilo on the first of the six creation days probably not much more than six thousand years ago. Since mainstream science draws a very different picture of reality, authoritative scientific sources have been briefly referred to, showing that biblical teaching can be found to be in harmony with sound natural science. Creation and the fall into sin are central events in Christian theology. It is decisive for sound ministry to know whether Genesis 1-11 is reliable history and what kind of history it is.
