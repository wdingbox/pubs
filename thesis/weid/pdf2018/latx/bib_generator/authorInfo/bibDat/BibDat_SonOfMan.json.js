            "intro": "The expression 'Son of Man', used in the Gospels almost exclusively by Jesus, has been the object of intensive study since the Protestant Reformation, yet scholars have come to no agreement on its origin or meaning. Research in this area has been described as 'a veritable mine field' and 'a can of worms'. Because of the scope and complexity of the literature, no comprehensive survey of the subject has been written in the twentieth century. Delbert Burkett's book fills this need. It provides a comprehensive historical overview of the debate from the patristic period to 1996, and gives an evaluation of that research and a summation of the present state of the question. Burkett concludes that despite nineteen centuries of 'Son of Man' study there is no consensus concerning the meaning or origin of the expression; the debate is therefore a prime example of the limits of New Testament scholarship.",

            "loc51:skepticism_gen": "Today scholarship can no longer take for granted that Jesus actually used this expressiion in the way the Gospel describe. We know know that the Gospels often attribute to Jesus ideas and sayings that actually originated at t a later time, in the life of the early Christian church. Even if Jesus did not use the expression, however, it remains important for understanding the origins of christology. Its frequent occurence in the Gospel tradition shows that it represented an important strand of thought in the early Chrsitian community. If it does not tell us about Jesus himself, it does tell us what the earliest Christian believed about Him",

            "loc51": "But what exatctly does it tell us? This is the problem. The Gospels never explain the phrase, and though it has been the object of intensive study since the Protestan Reformation, scholars have come to no agreement on even the most basic questions concerning it. ",

            "loc51_or_p2": "What does it mean? Where does it come fromm? To whom does it refer? Is it a title or not? Does it tell us something about Jesus or about the faith of the early church?",

            "p1": "The greek expression, 'the son of man', plays a key role in the christology of all four canonical Gospels. While it appears in about fifty different sayings in the NT, all but one of these occurs in the Gospels. There expression almost always occurs on the lips of Jesus. Since Jesus always speaks of the Son of Man in the third person, one could infer that he is referring to someone other than himself. ",

            "p1a": "This expression has been a central issue in NT studyies since the beginning of modern scholarshp. Because it is used almost exclusively by Jesus, many scholars have seen it as key to Jesus's own self-consciousness.",

            "p1b": "In the nineteen century, for example, H.J. Holtmann affirmed, 'nothing can be more certain than that He himself chose it as the most apt ... to designate what was typical of his personal nature, what was characteristic of his appearance and calling. Therein is contained the entire importance of the name'(H.Holtzmann 1865:213) ",

            "p2": "What does it mean? Where does it come fromm? To whom does it refer? Is it a title or not? Does it tell us something about Jesus or about the faith of the early church?",

            "p2a": "In 1996, Alberrt Schweitzer asserted, 'Broadly speaking .. the son-of-man problem is both historically sovable and has been sovled'(Schweitzer[1906]1968:283) ",

            "p3": "[Previous surveys of research:] Early surveyys of opinion on the 'Son of Man' problem appeared in commentaries, usually at the Mat8:20, where the term first occurs in the NT.(e.g. Wolf 1725; Kocher 1766) ",

            "p3a": "[Overview of the debate] Ab brief overview of the 'Son of Man'. The earliest interpretations of the expression were based on the Greek form of the phrase and took 'son' in a lieral, genealogical sense. Both patristic authors and Gnostics understood the phrase to identify Jesus as the son of some particular parent, such as Mary, Adam, or the Gnostic god Anthropes. This type of interpretation prevailed through the Middle Ages.",

            "p3b": "With the flourishing of Semitic studies after the Reformation, interpreters sought to identify the Semitic phrase the underlay the 'Son of Man'......",

            "p6": "Early orthodox writers interpreted the phrase as 'the of the human,' identifying 'the human' as Mary or Adam. After the Reformation, a few interpreters indentifed 'the human' as Joseph.",

            "p6": "[The fons Anthrops] In certain Gnostic ets, 'Anthropos'('Man') was the name of an 'aeon' or god.  This designation apparently develped from speculation on Gen1:26: if 'man' is made in the image of God, then God must in some sense be a primal 'Man'. In various Gnostic writings, a second god emanated from this first Man. This second god is identified as Christ and designated 'son of Man', i.e. son of the god Anthropos. Thus the Gnostics took 'Son' in a genealocial sense, identifying 'Man' as a god rather than a human being.",

            "p7": "[The son of the human] when patristic interpreters sought to explain 'son of (the) man', more explicitly, they took 'son' in a genealogical sense and 'the man' or 'the huamn' as a reference to a particular person.  ",

            "p8": "[The Son of Mary]Irenaeus stated, So he, the Son of God our Lord, being the Word of the Father, is also son of a human, because he had his human generation from Maryy -- who descended from humans and who was herself a human -- thus becoming the son of a human.(Adv Haer.3.19.3) ",

            "p10": "[weid]Female represent the clone from man, distinguish it. Jesus cannot be female, because Jesus derived from God.",

            "loc97": "Yet nineteen centuriees of 'Son of Man' study have led to no consensus concerning the meaning or origin of the expression. The 'Son of Man' debate thus serves as a prime illustration of the limits of NT scholarship.",

            "loc106": "The earliest interpreters of huios tos anthropos in a literal genealogical sense: for them it identified Jesus as the son of some particular parent. On the one hand, Gnostics interpreted the phrase as the 'son of Anthropoos', Anthrops being a Gnostic god. On the other hand, early orthodx writers interpreted the phrrase as 'the son of the human,' identifying 'the human' as Mary or Adam. After the Reformation, a few interpreters indentified 'the human' as Joseph. ",

            "loc151": "[Evaluation] These genialogical interpretations have been justly criticized. If the expression meant 'son of the human' indication descent from Mary, Joseph or Adam, why would Jesus so frequently emphasize that he was born of a human being when none of his beares had any doubt of this",

            "loc152": "The earliest interpreters, who spoke Greek as their native language, unanimously saw in the Greek phrase a filial relation between a son and a parent. What these interpreters did not recognize was the possibility that a Semitic expression underlay the Greek. As we shall see, it was this recogniation more than anything else that caused the genealoogical interrpretation to fall out of favor. ",

            "loc169": " 'the Son Man' might emphasize that which he had in ommon with humanity, wither human nature or human nature in its lowliness and weakness. On the other hand, the definite article before the phrrase might point to Jesus as the Son of Man par excellence, emphasizing that which set him apart as an extraordinary human being. These different possibilites fave rise to three varieties of interpretation: the Son of Man as the simply human, the lowly human, or the superior(ideal) human. ",

            "loc1063": "[Evaluation]The nontitular interpretation of 'Son of Man' in the Gospels has been around now for about 450 years. Various theories belongint to this class have a certain appeal....... The basic problem with the circumlocutional theory was: the idiom requires a demonstrative pronoum ('this man') which the Gospel expression lacks. As for the generic/indefinit interpretation, its chief weakness in all of its forms lies in the fact that it produces implausible results for all but a few of the Son of Man saying in the Gospels. Only one saying certainly reflects a generic bar enasha that hase been translated onverliterally as τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (Luk12:10, Matt 12:32). While a generic interpretation of 'son of man' has also been found plausible by numerous scholars in Mark 2.10 and 2.28 ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (Mark2:10)",

Both Eve's name, Hawwah, and Yahweh's are taken from a form of the Hebrew verb `to be', pointing to a common derivation. The meaning of her name is then `Life? or `She who gives Life?, as Adam?s subsequent naming of her as the `Mother of All Living? registers. The figure of Eve is still transparent to her former role, so that her deposition from mother goddess to human woman - from creator to created - can be clearly seen through the images. Demythologizing a goddess is a subtle process whereby the numinosity that once belonged to her is withdrawn and clothes another figure, in this case Yahweh. By contrast, Eve becomes the opposite of what she was, not a giver of life but a cause of death. In so far as she was formerly also creation or nature herself, this demythologizing process extends to the whole of nature, which becomes, like her, fallen and cursed. Consequently, death, once a phase in the totality of being wherein the dead return to the womb of the Mother Goddess for rebirth, is now a final and absolute punishment that she, or her reduced earthly counterpart, brought upon the world.",

            "p33b": "The etiological aspect of the name hawwab, Eve, in Gen 3:20 deserves another look. Jan Heller suspected that the phrase em-kol-bay, (mother of all living) itself could be construed as an honorific name or a title for a great lady. Heller speculated that a remote ancestor of the title, 'mother of all the living'  may have existed in a cult of the Great Mother or the Mother Goddess, although he did not provide literacy evidence from any source to support his conjecture. The recent publication of the Old Babylonian Atra-hasis epic, however, seems to give us a literal as well as a thematic parallel to the Genesis title. 'mother of all the living.' ",

            "p33c": "The word-for-word counterpart of 'mother of all the living' in that epic is found in the honorific name for the goddess Mami, the creatress, who is, at one point, called belet-kada-ili, 'mistress of all the gods'",

            "p33d": "It should note that the formula for this new name, 'x of all they y,' is the same as in the title for Eve, 'mother of all the living.' The same formular used for personal names has been isolated by Herbett Huffmon under the category of significant developments in the biblical material.",

            "p34d": "I would suggest, then, that behind the character of Eve was probably hidden the figure of the creatress of the mother-goddess Mami, and that hawwah Eve was an onomastic form derived from her title, 'em kol-hay. [Weid: why not to think that Mami was derived from Eve?]",

            "p35": "... The OT does not do away with the personality of Mami entirely but rather ascribes it to the figure of the first human mother. That is, Eve receives some of the attributes of the creatress in addition to the character of the created, and thereby a transparent added image is superimposed upon her.",

            "35b": "Qanity-ss-et-Yhwh: Further evidence may be adduced in support of the view that Eve is a fusion of two characters. The second and the only other time the name Eve appears in the OT is Gen 4:1, where Eve conceived and bore Cain and she said, qamiti-is-et-Yhweb, normally translated, 'I have gained a man et-Yhwh.' The usage of the grammatical element et- in the phrase et-Yhwh has caused no little controversy. But I believe that new light may now be shed on it.",

        "abstract": "By: Renberg, Adam Robert. 2020. Summary: This project explores the theological framework of Eusebius of Caesarea, focusing specifically on his understanding of the Son of God. Therein, it proposes and utilizes a unique lens to view the bishop—according to his exegetical strategies and his explicitly theological works. In doing so, Eusebius' primary understanding of the nature and role of the second person of the Trinity comes to the fore: the ‘Son is Truly Son.' That is to say, biblical personalism dictates his understanding of the persons in the Godhead. This is discussed in several facets of his thought. First, the Son's natural relation to the Father is seen to be both the distinguishing mark and the source of divine unity, according to Eusebius' framework for the Trinity. Second, his cosmological system demonstrates Eusebius' emphasis on the Son's unique nature as the image of the invisible God, the only one able to reveal the apophatic Father to creation. Third, his soteriology emphasizes biblical personalism through Christ's salvific work, as Christ is the teacher of the true religion and the Father—only the Son knows and is able to ‘image' him. Finally, Eusebius' theology of the incarnation emphasizes the unitive nature of Christ, in which the Son of God is likewise the Son of Man. Throughout, this project employs unique patristic interlocuters, underutilized Eusebian texts and paratextual devises, and the debate with Marcellus to demonstrate how his theological framework is within—and shapes—eastern theology, particularly from Origen to the Cappadocians. It also nuances and qualifies past assessments on some of Eusebius' suspect theology, particularly on his eternal subordinationism and Christology. Throughout, it is apparent that Eusebius is an important transmitter of Origenian theology and a foundational thinker for the later fourth and early fifth century.

My aim is to explain the historical and theological significance and to explore the constructive implications of Calvin’s ‘complex solidarity’ with the classical tradition in his approach to thinking and speaking of the Triune God, in light of and in dialogue with these debates centring on the bundle of themes – the divine processions and consubstantiality – at the heart of the doctrine of the Trinity. Chapter 1 is a discussion of Calvin’s doctrine of the Trinity in the 1559 Institutes.  In Chapter 2, I take up the controversies that form the context of Calvin’s autothean language, discussing those during his lifetime, first with Trinitarians and then with anti-Trinitarians.  Chapter 3 is my attempt to make theological sense of the historical shape of these debates, as well as the various approaches that arose after Calvin’s time, through offering an account of the role of the doctrine of eternal generation in classical Trinitarian theology. The aim is a faithful interpretation of the significance of the autothean controversies through grasping the complex of assumptions, convictions and claims at their heart, the theological shape of which I go on to consider throughout Chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 6, finally, is an initial foray into some further applications and implications of a Calvinian approach to thinking and speaking of the Triune God according to how he has given himself to be known, at this crucial nexus between Unity and Trinity.",

        "abstract": "By: Lee, Aquila Hyun-Il. 2003. Summary: The thesis seeks to clarify the development of early Christian understanding of Jesus as the pre-existent Son of God. We propose that its roots lie principally in early Christian exegesis of psalms in the light of Jesus' self-consciousness of divine sonship and divine mission. Part I reviews recent attempts to explain the development as a result of the influence of Jewish angelology and similar speculations. In Part II we argue that neither the personification of various attributes of God, including Wisdom, nor speculations about principal angels and a pre-existent messiah in Second Temple Judaism ever provided a ready-made category for viewing Jesus as a divine and pre-existent being alongside God. In Part III an examination of the Synoptic evidence for Jesus' self-consciousness of divine sonship and divine mission in the whole context of his life and teaching shows that his self-understanding was open to interpretation in terms of pre-existence. Part IV examines the early Christian use of Pss 110:1 and 2:7 against this background. We propose that the root of pre-existent Son christology is to be found in early Christian exegesis of these two messianic psalms (the catalyst) in the light of Jesus' self-consciousness of divine sonship and divine mission (the foundation). The tremendous impact left by the resurrection event and the resulting conception of Jesus 'literally' enthroned to God's right hand led them to see Jesus as the pre-existent Lord and Son of God. In Part V it is argued that the pre-Pauline 'sending' formula 'God sent his Son' (Gal 4:4-5; Rom 8:304; Jn 3:16-17; and 1 Jn 4:9) derives from this understanding of Jesus as the pre-existent Son of God rather than from divine wisdom christology. Once Jesus' divinity and pre-existence were confirmed through the exegesis of the psalms, Jewish wisdom traditions were helpful in drawing out the fall significance of his pre-existence in terms of his being active in creation and co-eternal with God the Father.

        "abstract": "By: Brindle, Wayne A. 1988. Summary: This dissertation aims to define the title 'Son of God' as applied to Jesus Christ in the Synoptic Gospels.In the Old Testament the term 'son of God' was variously applied to angels, Israel, Israelites, Davidic kings, and possibly to the Messiah. In intertestamental Judaism the term was used mainly with reference to Israel and its righteous people, and is never specifically applied to the Messiah. In Hellenistic literature the title was sometimes given to pagan kings, emperors, and certain heroes. None of these occurrences can form the background for the Synoptic use of the title.In the Synoptic Gospels Jesus uses only two titles of Himself: Son and Son of Man. With the title 'Son' Jesus related Himself closely to God the Father in a unique and exclusive sense, particularly in such passages as Matthew 11:27 and Mark 12:6. Jesus always addresses God in prayer as 'Abba,' a term never addressed to God by contemporary Palestinian Jews. At His trial Jesus publicly and clearly accepts the full title 'Son of God' for Himself while claiming exclusive association with God, highlighted by a resulting charge of blasphemy. Matthew, Mark, and Luke each emphasize Jesus's sonship as divinity rather than simple messiahship.Normally beings with supernatural insight designate Jesus as the Son of God: Gabriel, Satan, demons, Peter, and the heavenly voice at His baptism and Transfiguration. Jesus' sonship requires a supernatural revelation and announcement. Even a pagan Roman centurion confesses Jesus' sonship through the divine revelation of the cross. The key revelation occurs at Jesus' baptism, where the perspective of the Father is given.In virtually every reference to Jesus' sonship, it is either His supernatural origin, His unique relationship to the Father, or His claim to equality with God that is highlighted. The title may thus be defined as expressing that unique attribute of Jesus Christ by which He exclusively and ontologically shares the divine nature and character of His heavenly Father, revealing God to man as no other can do, and carrying out perfectly God's purposes as Messiah, Servant, and eternal Sovereign.

        "abstract": "By: Reynolds, Benjamin E. 2007. Summary: This thesis argues that the title ‘Son of Man’ in the Gospel of John is an apocalyptic reference that highlights, among a number of things, that Jesus is a heavenly figure. The background of ‘Son of Man’ can be traced from the ‘one like a son of man’ in Daniel 7 and the interactions of this figure in Jewish apocalyptic and early Christian literature. Although there is no established ‘Son of Man concept’, the Danielic son of man is interpreted with common characteristics that suggest there was at least some general understanding of this figure in the Second Temple period. Thos common characteristics are noticeable throughout the Son of Man sayings in John’s Gospel, and the context and the interpretation of these sayings point to an understanding of the Johannine Son of Man similar to those in the interpretations of the Danielic figure. However, even though these similarities exist, the Johannine figure is distinct from the previous interpretations, just as they are distinct from one another. One obvious difference is the present reality of the Son of Man’s role in judgment and salvation. The Johannine Son of Man is an apocalyptic figure, and thus ‘Son of Man’ does not function to draw attention to Jesus’ humanity in the Gospel of John. Nor is the title synonymous with ‘Son of God’. ‘Son of Man’ points to aspects of Jesus’ identity that are not indicated by any other title. Along with the other titles, it helps to complete the Johannine portrait of Jesus. University: University of Aberdeen.

        "abstract": "By: Ketterling, Matthew D. 2018. Summary: This thesis attempts to understand Paul's deployment of divine sonship language with respect to the community of believers by bringing Romans into sustained conversation with one text from the Jewish tradition, namely, The Book of Jubilees. I argue throughout that a comparison between divine sonship in the two texts is justified because both authors collocate with the theme of “God's sons” the same series of motifs, including a divinely given spirit, law fulfillment, renewed creation, and Abrahamic descent. My central thesis is that Paul assumes certain characteristics of the sons of God in the logic of Romans, and that Paul shares similar assumptions with the author of Jubilees. In other words, one can detect a narrative substructure underlying Paul's descriptions of the “sons of God” that demonstrates marked similarities with the narrative of the sons of God in Jubilees. Just as the explicit logic of covenant membership in Jubilees holds together the collocation of motifs including divine sonship, the giving of the divine spirit, law fulfillment, new creation, and Abrahamic descent, so an analogous, though implicit, covenantal logic in Romans brings together the same motifs. This does not mean, however, that the two authors bring together the collocation of motifs in the same manner. In fact, reading Jubilees and Romans together highlights clear differences in conclusions. Nevertheless, these differences only further serve to illustrate that both Paul and Jubilees work with similar assumptions about the sons of God despite their theological differences.

        "abstract": "By: Fay, Ronald C. 2006. Summary: This dissertation answers two distinct questions. First, is Paul trinitarian? Second, would the original recipients of Romans understand Paul as being trinitarian? In order to answer these questions, this work examines the discrete unit of Romans 8 and the first-century Roman theological landscape in order to ascertain the answers to these questions. Chapter 2 surveys Roman religious life, taking a few specific cults as examples. Special attention is paid to Jupiter, Isis, Mithras, and the Imperial Cult. Within the analysis of each cult, issues of salvation and the structure of the belief are explored. The Imperial Cult evinces the tendency of Romans to accept that humans are or can become gods. Romans 8 is the sample of Paul's writings used to answer the above questions since it speaks of the Holy Spirit while also discussing God and Jesus. In Romans 8, Paul answers the problem of sin found in Romans 7 and also discusses how the law fits into the equation. He does not attack the law but rather the flesh as the problem, since the flesh accedes to the demands of sin just as the law was perverted by sin. Therefore, Paul discusses the role of God, Jesus, and the Spirit in overcoming the problem of sin in terms of salvation and in terms of the ongoing life of those who believe. Paul explicitly describes the actions of God, paying special attention to the importance of adoption and the renewal of creation (recreation). God uses the Son and the Spirit as agents in causing salvation. The interrelations and congruent functions of the Son and Spirit point toward a unity not found in Roman religion, since when Roman gods coincide functionally, one god assimilates or eliminates the other. The thesis this dissertation defends is that when taking into account his Jewish background and the Roman context into which he was writing, Paul communicates the Father, Son, and Spirit as a triunity to his readers in Romans 8.

More specifically, it will illustrate an effective model of the spiritual father and son relationship between pastors and their leaders and followers showing how to duplicate the same patterns according to God’s design for the Church. The rationale for this topic is derived from perceiving the need to address the deficiency in the effective duplication of leadership within the Church. Regarding leadership, much of the Church has neglected or deviated from the need for spiritual fathers to leaders and how this biblical concept and principle is to be used in an effective and legacy-building Church. This research will be approached first by giving historical and current data of the father-like relationship biblical leaders had with their followers and its significance. This research will utilize Scriptural models of relationships between leaders and followers in the Bible to demonstrate how churches can effectively apply this spiritual fatherhood model for the concept of sonship.

        "abstract": "By: Smith, D. Blair. 2019. Summary: Not until the fourth century did the fatherhood of God become an issue of sustained analysis in Christian theology. This thesis explores the distinctiveness of the Father within four representative Trinitarian theologies: Athanasius of Alexandria, Hilary of Poitiers, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Basil of Caesarea. It will be shown that Athanasius presents problems in offering a coherent account. I will argue, however, for a subtle progression within his thought and across the chapters, which reaches maturity in Basil's integrative theology of fatherhood. The Father-Son relation served as the starting point for discussing the shape of the Godhead. Within that relation, the logic of the eternal birth affirms the Father as source while also creating theological 'space' for understanding the Father's 'loving gift' of himself. The consequences of the perfect gift within divine simplicity lead to emphases on the coinherence and inseparability of operations of the divine persons. Strong notes of unity are struck by such teaching, yet they lead back to the source of that unity and, thus, to the mystery of the Father. Within pro-Nicene thought, attention eventually turned to the Holy Spirit. While the Spirit does not possess a filial relation, he, too, was conceived of in terms of an origin in the Father. A mature doctrine of the Spirit brings about a robust understanding of the inseparability of the Trinitarian persons in God's redemptive purposes. One movement of grace extends from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit, so that worshippers are enabled to return back to their source. The tension brought about in speaking of source and inseparability highlights the mystery of the Father whose 'loving gift' not only eternally constitutes the shape of Trinitarian relations - it also is the genesis of his own 'perfection' as through it the fullness of the Father is understood.

        "abstract": "By: Ellingwood, Jane. 2015. Summary: My primary argument in this thesis is that creation theologies significantly influenced early developments in the doctrine of the Trinity, especially in Augustine of Hippo’s theology. Thus this is a work of historical theology, but I conclude with proposals for how Augustine’s theologies of creation and the Trinity can be read fruitfully with modern theology. I critically analyse developments in trinitarian theologies in light of ideas that were held about creation. These include the doctrine of creation ‘out of nothing’ and ideas about other creative acts (e.g., forming or fashioning things). Irenaeus and other early theologians posited roles for God (the Father), the Word / Son, the Spirit, or Wisdom in creative acts without working out formal views on economic trinitarian acts. During the fourth century trinitarian controversies, creation ‘out of nothing’ and ideas about ‘modes of origin’ influenced thinking on consubstantiality and relations within the Trinity. Basil of Caesarea and others also presented ideas about trinitarian acts of creation and the Trinity in hexaemeral works. I will argue that in Augustine’s views of trinitarian acts of creation, he attributes roles to God (the Father), the Word / Son, and the Spirit. In his mature theology, he attributes the giving of formless existence, differentiated existence, and perfected existence to the three Persons respectively, while depicting shared roles. He also attributes to the Spirit the giving of the capability of ‘dynamic abiding’ to creatures, which gives them agency in continuing their existence. Augustine’s theologies of creation and the Trinity were significantly influenced by his exegesis of Gen. 1, John 1. 1-3, Wisdom, and other scriptures, and his ideas resonate with the hexaemeral works of Basil and Philo of Alexandria. I argue that scholars should examine these sources and Augustine’s own hexaemeral commentaries to gain a deeper understanding of his trinitarian theology. University: University of Exeter.

Through Jesus'identification with'the whole human condition,'we are offered the possibility of both enduring and overcoming suffering. Similarly, the temptations are understood beyond the wilderness temptation narrative since Jesus experiences them throughout his ministry. Ellul believes temptations are ultimately human avenues for tempting God, and so focuses on the discussion power and'non-power,'be it on personal or political levels.

In Mat.19:5, Christ cites this language as the word of God. That, however, makes no difference; since Adam may utter the word of God derived from the divine fact, as well as the narrator. It seems to favor the idea of the narrators' speaking, that he so often inserts his remarks with and el-kon (wherefore; Gen 10:9 see Delitzsch). On this account Keil decides that it is the language of the narrator, especially since it is spoken of father and mother. Delitzsch, however, insists that the words must be taken as a prophetic or divining expresson of Adam himself. The word must evidently have the significance of a moral life-ordering for all humanity -- a meaning which results from this expression maness, or woman. It is, therefore, most closely connected with what precedes, and suits better here the mouth of Adam than that of narrator. With the latter it would have been merely a historical remark, with which, moreover, the future tesse would not have been consistent. In the mouth of Adam it is a law of life for all human time, and, indeed, of such a nature that it expresses, at the same time, a feeling of self-denial in that he givees too his children, in the conclusion of marriage, a free departuure from  the ancestral home. It is evident that here all the fundamental laws of the marriage-life are indicated. 1. The foundadation of the same, the sexual affinity; 2. the freedom of choice (as this avails also for the wife in relation too the recognition of the man, and the free departure from father and mother); 3. the monogamic form of marriage and its original indissolubility. They become one flesh--an expression which does indeed include the sexual connection, but, as somthing lying beyond all that, it express the essential unity and higher wholeness of man in man and wife. 4. The relativity of the departure from father and mother; the first relation is not take away by the second, by only made subordinate to it; it supposes the relations to be normal."

Without a revelation from God, he discovers in the woman “ bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh .” The words, “ this is now ( הפּעם lit., this time ) bone of my bones,” etc., are expressive of joyous astonishment at the suitable helpmate, whose relation to himself he describes in the words, “ she shall be called Woman, for she is taken out of man .” אשּׁה is well rendered by Luther, “ Männin ” (a female man), like the old Latin vira from vir . The words which follow, “ therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall become one flesh,” are not to be regarded as Adam's, first on account of the על־כּן, which is always used in Genesis, with the exception of Genesis 20:6; Genesis 42:21, to introduce remarks of the writer, either of an archaeological or of a historical character, and secondly, because, even if Adam on seeing the woman had given prophetic utterance to his perception of the mystery of marriage, he could not with propriety have spoken of father and mother. They are the words of Moses, written to bring out the truth embodied in the fact recorded as a divinely appointed result, to exhibit marriage as the deepest corporeal and spiritual unity of man and woman, and to hold up monogamy before the eyes of the people of Israel as the form of marriage ordained by God. But as the words of Moses, they are the utterance of divine revelation; and Christ could quote them, therefore, as the word of God (Matthew 19:5). By the leaving of father and mother, which applies to the woman as well as to the man, the conjugal union is shown to be a spiritual oneness, a vital communion of heart as well as of body, in which it finds its consummation. This union is of a totally different nature from that of parents and children; hence marriage between parents and children is entirely opposed to the ordinance of God. Marriage itself, notwithstanding the fact that it demands the leaving of father and mother, is a holy appointment of God; hence celibacy is not a higher or holier state, and the relation of the sexes for a pure and holy man is a pure and holy relation. This is shown in Genesis 2:25 : “ They were both naked ערוּמּים, with dagesh in the מ, is an abbreviated form of עירמּים Genesis 3:7, from עוּר to strip), the man and his wife, and were not ashamed .” Their bodies were sanctified by the spirit, which animated them. Shame entered first with sin, which destroyed the normal relation of the spirit to the body, exciting tendencies and lusts which warred against the soul, and turning the sacred ordinance of God into sensual impulses and the lust of the flesh."

In some case, the social father of a child is not the biological father.",

            "p30": "In order to accurately convey divine fatherhood and sonship, translators need to use expression that are as equivalent in meaning as possible to the Greek and Hebrew terms for social son(huios and ben) and social father (patre and ab) and to avoid biological expressions of the form God's Offsprint or the Procerator of our Lord Jesus Christ, because these are understood to signify biological relations generated through a sexual act of procreation. In this way translators can enable new audiences to understand the biblical sense in which God is our father and Christ is his son, as well as understand the relationship of Joseph to the boy Jesus."

If male and female together signifies relationship with God and salvation, homosexuality becomes a symbol of everything the Christian is not.”",

In antiquity, “son of god”—meaning a ruler designated by the gods to carry out their will—was a title used by the Roman emperor Augustus and his successors as a way to reinforce their divinely appointed status. But this title was also used by early Christians to speak about Jesus, borrowing the idiom from Israelite and early Jewish discourses on monarchy. This interdisciplinary volume explores what it means to be God's son(s) in ancient Jewish and early Christian literature. Through close readings of relevant texts from multiple ancient corpora, including the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Greco-Roman texts and inscriptions, early Christian and Islamic texts, and apocalyptic literature, the chapters in this volume engage a range of issues including messianism, deification, eschatological figures, Jesus, interreligious polemics, and the Roman and Jewish backgrounds of early Christianity and the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The essays in this collection demonstrate that divine sonship is an ideal prism through which to better understand the deep interrelationship of ancient religions and their politics of kingship and divinity. In addition to the editors, the contributors to this volume include Richard Bauckham, Max Botner, George J. Brooke, Jan Joosten, Menahem Kister, Reinhard Kratz, Mateusz Kusio, Michael A. Lyons, Matthew V. Novenson, Michael Peppard, Sarah Whittle, and N. T. Wright.",

            "p9": "Reinhard G. Kratz     SONS OF GOD” IN THE HEBREW BIBLE AND ANCIENT JUDAISM     The claim of Jesus to be the son of God, asserted by the New Testament, is one of the most difficult aspects of Christian religion. It not only makes Chris-tianity’s relationship to its mother religion, Judaism, difficult but also presents significant problems for Christianity in the modern world. The description of a person or a heavenly being as “son of God” is not self-evident, particularly under the conditions of the Enlightenment and according to our categories of under-standing. God and heavenly beings belong to a reality that defies the worldview of the modern era. This applies even more to the genealogical relationship that is expressed by the term “son.” To put it quite simply: since, with our usual (modern) categories of understanding, we cannot say who or what God is, there is no way we can know who or what a “son of God” is.Philology helps us a little here. “Son of God (the gods)” (אלהיםבן or similar) isa generic term and means nothing but “god” in the same way that “son of man” (אדםבן) is“man” and “son of an ox” (בקרבן) is“ox.” This means that the title “s on of God” in itself does not describe the relationship o f father and son but ex presses the divine nature of an earthly or heavenly figure—something that is difficult enough to understand in terms of our modern thinking or on the basis of Jewish and Christian monotheism.In the ancient Near East, however, as in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testa-ment, and other writings of ancient Judaism and early Christianity, we encounter statements that conform neither to grammar nor to pure doctrine. In the myths of Ugarit and other ancient Near Eastern cultures, gods and divine couples have children by means of procreation and birth. The myth of the procreation and birth of a god spells out the idea of the divine attribute in the form of a narrative. This            ."

In this book, Michael Peppard desires to understand the title 'son of god' as it was heard and understood in the first century.",
