        "abstract": ": Humans are an ultrasocial species. This sociality, however, cannot be fully explained by the canonical approaches found in evolutionary biology, psychology, or economics. Understanding our unique social psychology requires accounting not only for the breadth and intensity of human cooperation but also for the variation found across societies, over history, and among behavioral domains. Here, we introduce an expanded evolutionary approach that considers how genetic and cultural evolution, and their interaction, may have shaped both the reliably developing features of our minds and the well-documented differences in cultural psychologies around the globe. We review the major evolutionary mechanisms that have been proposed to explain human cooperation, including kinship, reciprocity, reputation, signaling, and punishment; we discuss key culture–gene coevolutionary hypotheses, such as those surrounding self-domestication and norm psychology; and we consider the role of religions and marriage systems. Empirically, we synthesize experimental and observational evidence from studies of children and adults from diverse societies with research among nonhuman primates.

        "abstract": "At one time or another, every sincere follower of Jesus struggles to formulate a Christian perspective regarding divorce. A major stumbling block to discerning our Lord’s will about divorce is the apparent inconsistency between Jesus’ teachings in Matthew 5 and 19 and his teaching in Mark 10. The exception phrase, “except for marital unfaithfulness,” in Matt 5:32, 19:91 appears to be granting permission for divorce to the husband of an adulterous wife. In contrast, Mark omits the exception phrase and seems to allow no provision whatsoever for divorce.   This article resolves the dilemma by interpreting Matt 19:9 in light of a cultural difference between the more Jewish perspective of Matthew’s gospel and the more Gentile perspective of Mark’s gospel. As we shall see later, Matthew’s exception phrases are not exceptions that allow for divorce when a spouse commits adultery. Instead, they are cultural contingency phrases designed to provide the same guidance against divorce and remarriage to Jewish women which Mark 10:11–12 provided to Gentile men and women, and Matt 19:9 (minus the exception phrase) provided to Jewish men.       The divorce pericopae in both Matthew and Mark represent Jesus’ desire to curtail the rampant divorce rates plaguing the Jewish and Gentile societies in his day. From the heart of God, Jesus affirmed that marriage should not end through divorce.",

        "abstract": "Dealing with the methodological challenge of historical expounding, this paper discusses the historical formation of child protection with regard to the history of ideas. The aim is to identify the early intellectual grounds of the idea of child protection. Due to the fact that the genesis and evolution of child protection are shaped by many kinds of moral, social, educational, judicial and political interests as well as varied educational, psychological, sociological and medical theories of child development, it is exceedingly laborious to define its core content. As a political concept, it germinated especially from aware people’s societal and ethical awareness of the social distress of children and families in modernising societies. As a construction of the human mind, it concerns essentially values, cognition and political aspirations. The emergence of organised child protection activities can be viewed as a reaction to the social change of each prevailing time shaped by country-specific societal and cultural features, including national moralities and ways of judicial and political thinking. However, there are also many common elements in the midst of diverse traditions, policies and practices of child protection. In the course of time child protection issues have been worked at more and more in international contexts. In the last three to four decades it has been externalised increasingly in terms of international conventions connecting closely with the concept of the rights of the child.

        "abstract": "First Corinthians 6:12-7:7 and Eph 5:21-33 present opposing views about the values and dangers of sex and marriage. In 1 Corinthians, sex with outsiders precludes one from unity with the spiritual body of Christ, and marriage is a means to avoid illicit sexuality and to keep from 'burning.' In Ephesians, marriage is characterized by hierarchy, yet the husband-wife relationship is analogous to that of Christ and the church. These texts reach their different conclusions even though they share cultural and rhetorical resources: scriptural recitation of Gen 2:24 and the metaphor of the community as a body. This article analyzes the body metaphors in each text, using cognition-based theories of conceptual metaphor and paying attention to how the Genesis recitations function in the metaphor. The analysis demonstrates how marriage and sexuality are topics that the authors use to discuss yet another idea--the spiritual or mysterious union of the community with Christ. This topic, along with the visual potential of the body metaphor, infuses arguments about sexuality and gender with importance beyond issues of family life and reproduction.

        "abstract": "The theme of sonship is one of the central themes in the New Testament. Sometimes it can be traced explicitly, but more often indirectly. True sonship involves obedience to parents and, as a result, leads to parental blessing. This is the truth the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews wanted to convey to his readers. He did this using the example of Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God. He, being the true the Son, consubstantial to Father, showed complete and unconditional obedience, despite the strongest temptations and incredible suffering. His obedience to the Father not only led Him to glory, not only showed the holy essence and wisdom of God Himself, but also led and leads to the glory of His followers. Called by God and saved by Him, having become His children, in obedience to God, must become like the Son of God, as the Firstborn. Only a consecrated life leads one to blessings. The foundation of such a life is faith in Jesus Christ and living according to His commandments. Apostasy from Him and transgression of God's commandments deprives a person of blessing and grace. Most scholars of the Epistle to the Hebrews place more emphasis on the Sonship of Christ and His High Priesthood, and this is important to show the members of the community the superiority of what they have in Jesus over Judaism. However, there are few who emphasize the obedience of the Son of God to His Heavenly Father and its consequences, as well as an example of this obedience for followers of Jesus Christ. The author of the Epistle wants to show that not only the confession of Jesus Christ as Lord, but also obedience is a guarantee of blessing. It was the disobedience of the community members that led them to God's punishment, caused a crisis of faith, and led to apostasy. A true son is an obedient son. If there are any mentions of Christ's obedience and His example for His followers in the studies of various authors, then they are very short and local. Therefore, the task of this study is a deeper ",

        "abstract": "In recent decades the opponents of same-sex marriage have mounted a “second front” in the debate, shifting their focus from the so-called clobber texts to the creation narratives of Genesis. These scholars argue that Gen 2:24 presents a normative definition of marriage that precludes same-sex marriage. I argue that Gen 2:24 offers not a normative definition of the institution of marriage but a description of the powerful draw to relationship that is the result of God’s actions in creation. Just as interpreters of Gen 2:24 across centuries and traditions have approached the verse against the background of a wide range of presenting social issues (e.g., divorce, incest, polygamy, bestiality, and, more recently, homosexuality), so the authors of Gen 2:24 were influenced by a pressing social issue, namely, intermarriage. I explore this hypothesis by means of a word study focusing on the verse’s two verbs. The results of the word study are further tested by consideration of the historical and literary contexts of the verse and of the earliest instances of reuse of Gen 2:24 in canonical and noncanonical texts. I conclude that, far from presenting a normative definition of heterosexual marriage, Gen 2:24 is an acknowledgment of the powerful attraction that causes human beings to seek relationship in opposition to the wishes of their parents, society, and religion.

Topics addressed include reflection of the varying etiologies of the verse, a grammatical analysis of the verse, and questions regarding its identity as a tragic or trite statement.

        "quotes": {
            "p97a": "problem 1: for a patriarchal society like ancient Israel it would have been more appropriate to say that a wife leaves her father and mother and cleaves to her husband, since the wife more obviously leaves her family than the man his. Therefore, some detect in this verse an echo of a matriarchal culture. But G. von Rad is no doubt correct when he says that this narrative 'is concerned not with a legal custom but with a natural drive.'",

            "p97b": "problem2: But there is a deeper problem. In the rich narrative in which it is embedded the verse sounds trite.. Triteness in literature and art is not always easy to judge. One must consider whether a phrase, scene, or painting seems hackneyed because of subsequent rather than prior usage. Moreover, ancient writers, redactors, and glossators were not immune from triteness, and we must also be careful not to fault ancient literature simply because of our own tastes. Biblical writers were more interested in etiologies than we are. ... Is there an alternate explanation?",

            "p98a": "The Hebrew imperfect can be used with a potential force, corresponding to English 'can, may, should, would, could,' The usage can also occur in reference to past time.  In short, the verse can be understood as a description of divine intention rather than of habitually observed fact. It is true that there has been no mention of parenting in the narrative so far, but the reference to 'father and mother' can easily be excused as poetic license.",

            "p98b": "If taken as suggested above, the verse becomes part of the series of reversals that occur after the Fall. Just as 2:25 is reversed by 3:7, so the unity desired in 2:24 is broken when the man does not accept responsibility for his own action but blames his wife(3:12). So 2:24 casts its shadow over the following narrative, helping to underline the tragedy of the Fall. ",

            "p98c": "Given the biblical interest in etiology, it is difficult to say if the understanding of the verse suggested here is more probable than the traditional one. But it is, at least, a tempting possibility.",

Heth, Professor of Greek and New Tesament, Taylor University, Upland, IN This novel approach incorporates a holistic view of Scripture that produces surprisingly enlightening insights. Regular summaries guide the reader through a detailed analysis using modern metaphor theory to arrive at a valuable conclusion. - David Instone-Brewer, Senior Research Fellow, Tyndale House, Cambridge 'In this book Hamer presents a fresh and persuasive new perspective on the Old Testament roots of New Testament teaching on marriage, with great significance for contemporary debates on the nature of Christian marriage. It deserves to be widely read.' - Professor David Clough, Professor of Theological Ethics, Department of Theology and Religious Studies, University of Chester In this work Dr. Hamer challenges many centuries of academic scholarship and ecclesiastical assumptions about divorce. Readers will find substantive arguments based on the Judeo-Christian scriptures, extra-biblical writings, and metaphor theory. The writer's unique contribution ventures beyond Dr. Instone-Brewer's groundbreaking work on the topic and conceptualizes not only the Judeo milieu of divorce statements in the Old and New Testaments but how key passages such as Genesis 2:23-24 may impact the possibility of divorce in gospel and epistolary literature. Many contemporary scholars look at marriage, divorce, and remarriage from a constricted standpoint; Dr. Hamer takes readers to an unprecedented level in order to provide a broader understanding. Readers will not go away unchallenged. - Richard M. Cozart, Professor at College of Biblical Studies, Houston, Texas 'Hamer... challenges the consensus view that the marriage of Adam and Eve in Gen 2:24 represents an ontological unity in marriage, suggesting several important implications for marriage and divorce. Hamer is to be commended for assembling this material and his conclusions should be considered in further discussions of the marriage metaphor.' - Phillip J. Long, Professor of Bible and Biblical Languages, Grace Bible College, SW In this important and thoroughly researched thesis, Dr Hamer has resolved the conundrum of God's concern for marriage and the texts of scripture that appear to give conflicting instruction about people who are divorced. It provides a vitally important insight into God's healing solution for those who, like Himself, have experienced the rejection of their love. - Rev Dr Tom Holland, Senior Research Fellow, The Wales Evangelical School of Theology",

        "abstract": "The rapid moral and cultural changes in Western society have not left the evangelical church unscathed. Instead, an increasing number of scholars, self-professed evangelicals included, are lining up to offer their affirming interpretations of the key biblical texts related to the same-sex discussion. One area in particular that has seen a seismic shift within evangelical circles is the push for the acceptance of 'Christian' same-sex marriage. The purpose of marriage to combat loneliness as found in Genesis 2 vis-à-vis the mandate of procreation in Gen 1:26-28 represents the heart of the debate. Does Genesis 2 support same-sex marriage on the basis of kinship ties as opposed to procreation as taught in Gen 1:26-28? This paper argues that affirming scholars have misinterpreted Gen 2:18-25 as promoting only kinship ties and not procreation as well. Moreover, Gen 2:18-25 must be read in light of Gen 1:26-28. Indeed, Gen 2:18, 20, and 24 serve as the basis for promoting procreation and physical fittedness within marriage. This paper will also show how a number of ancillary arguments used as biblical 'support' for same-sex marriage are either false dichotomies or are simply wrong when placed against the rubric of Scripture. Only one paradigm for marriage appears within the Bible, namely, heterosexual marriage established by God himself in Gen 2:24 and reaffirmed by Jesus in Matthew 19 and Mark 10.

        "quotes": {
            "p683": "one text in particular, Gen 2:18-24, has been the focus of affirming scholars in their efforts to find validity for same-sex marriage.  The central purpose of Gen 2:24 was to teach the Israeliet audience(and by extension, all humanity) about the sancitty of marriage and the antiquity of the institution. God was there at the beginning bringing validity to thiis fundamental scocietal pillar within which family could be formed and thrive.",

            "p684a": "(1) Gen2:18-25 seems to be painting fuller picture of Gen 1:26-28 (2) the grammar of Gen2:18 and 20 points to the fittdness of the male and female bodies for sexual pleasure in marriage; (3) the phrase 'one flesh' in Gen 2:24 is not isolated to knship ties alone, but also has procreation in view. ",

            "p684b": "the historical-critical assertion that the two creatioons accounts found in Gen 1:1-2:4a and 2:4b-25 stem from two different sources and present two completely different creation accounts with different foci. According to source theorists, the first accoount is attributed to the putative Priestly author and the latter account is assigned to the so-called Yahwist/'J' source. The argument is therefore propoosed that the Priestly source focuses on procreation as seen in Gen1:28 whereas J source is concerned with kinship ties tthat remedy loneliness as exemplifiied in Gen 2:18. Based upon this mnany affiming scholars are more than willing to offer their full support for the inclusion of same-sex couples and marriage in the church.",

            "p685b": "Do the two creation accounts present two contraditioary stories of creation?",

            "p686":"It seems more likely that the second account in some way complemented the first account. Even McKeown concludes that the two accounts are 'complementary' with the second one covering select aspects of the creation event in more detail. And E.EE. Speiser notes that even though these may be from different sources, 'the subject matter is ultimately the same in both sources.'  Chapter 1 focuses on the 'heavens and earth' whereas chapter 2 centers on 'earth and heaven', which push one to the concluusion that chapter 2 compiments chapter 1 by zeroing in on the creation and role of human. T. Desmond Alexander concurs that these chapters are complementary: one broadly focused and the other 'zoomed in'. It seems evident that this zooming in is for the purpose of drawing attention to the creation of the Garden of Eden, its animals, and the man and the woman."

Evangelicals have not been left unscathed. In light of these concerns, this paper examines postmodernism's rapid onslaught and deconstruction of the basic Genesis mandates related to sexual ethics and the order of the species as sanctioned by God in the opening two chapters of Genesis. I will conclude that due to these strong influences by postmodernist values, Western society has seen the devolution and deconstruction of five basic mandates--in a somewhat reversed order--as decreed by God. These mandates include: the distinction of the species (1:24-26), the institution of gender (1:27), marriage (2:18-24a), procreation (1:28; 2:24b), and the centrality of the family (2:24; 4:1). The result has been not only the fracturing of society and the secularization of the church in the West, but the eroding of these God-given mandates even within evangelical churches.

Moreover, in Matthew 19:5, our Lord quotes these words as spoken by God, and the simplest interpretation of this declaration is that the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God to give this solemn sanction to marriage, founded upon Adam’s words. The great and primary object of this part of the narrative is to set forth marriage as a Divine ordinance. The narrator describes Adam’s want, pictures him as examining all animal life, and studying the habits of all creatures so carefully as to be able to give them names, but as returning from his search unsatisfied. At last one is solemnly brought to him who is his counterpart, and he calls her Ishah, his feminine self, and pronounces her to be his very bone and flesh. Upon this, “He who at the beginning made them male and female “pronounced the Divine marriage law that man and wife are one flesh.",
