Moreover, this Christological concept stands at the center of today’s Bible translation debates and increased ministry efforts to Muslims. New Testament scholar D. A. Carson sheds light on this important issue with his usual exegetical clarity and theological insight, first by broadly surveying Jesus’s biblical name as “the Son of God,\" and then by focusing on two key texts that speak of Christ’s sonship. The book concludes with the implications of Jesus’s divine sonship for how modern Christians think and speak about Christ, especially in relation to Bible translation and missionary engagement with Muslims across the globe.\n\n“No christological designation is as essential as ‘Son of God’; none is more important. This study makes that impressively clear by sound and careful exegesis and theological reflection in the face of misunderstandings and disputes, past and current. Once again, D. A. Carson serves the church well.”\n\n“What does it mean for us to confess that Jesus is the Son of God? D. A. Carson tackles this question in Jesus the Son of God. In this little book he lays a firm foundation to help the church understand ‘Son of God’ with reference to Jesus. After considering uses of ‘Son of God’ in Scripture, both in general and when applied to Jesus, Carson models the way systematic theology should be based on solid biblical exegesis. Carson is especially concerned to bring his study to bear on the controverted issue in missiological circles concerning how to present Jesus as Son of God in Christian and Muslim contexts. Here he critically, but kindly, calls for rethinking new translations that have replaced references to God the Father and Jesus as his Son to make them more acceptable to Muslims."

        "abstract": "In this study, we must first examine the Biblical usage of two Greek words. These two words are “teknon” and “huios.” Though both are translated as “son,” in various translations, these two words are distinct.\n\n(1) Teknon (John 1:12; 11:52; Rom. 8:16-17, 21; 9:8; Phil 2:15; I John 3:1-2, 10)\nThe Greeks normally used this word to speak of one who is a descendant by birth. It is in most instances translated as “children,” and often as a designation of believers in Christ. John uses it exclusively this way. Christians are declared to be children of God (John 1:12; I John 3:1-2,10), having been born into His family. This word could actually be rendered “a born-one.”\n\n(2) Huios (Matt. 5:9; Luke 20:36; Rom. 8:14, 19; Gal. 3:26)\nThe Greeks normally used this word to describe a relationship brought about by the legal act of adoption. Paul’s use of the word is placed within this context (Greek word – huiothesia, meaning “the placing of sons,” used in Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:5-7). This act of adoption was of great significance in the ancient Greek world.\n\nIn the Western world we think of adoption in terms of taking a child from one family and making it a member of another. However, the Greek or Roman father adopted as a son his own child. Birth made him a child (teknon); adoption made him a son (huios). Between the period of birth and adoption, there were stages of growth, education and discipline, until the maturity was reached for adoption into sonship. With adoption the son was recognized as one who could faithful represent the father. He had arrived at the point of maturity, where the father could entrust him with the responsibility of overseeing the family business. The son becomes the “heir” of his father’s inheritance. Birth gives one the right to the inheritance, but adoption gives one the participation in the inheritance.\n\nR. B. Jones, Bible commentator states: “To be a son is infinitely more than to be a child, and the terms are never loosely used by the Holy Spirit. It is not a difference in relationship, but in position. Every “born again” child of God has in him the nature of His Father, and is a beloved member of His Father’s family. Adoption cannot make the child any nearer or dearer, yet it gives the child a status he did not enjoy before, a position he did not occupy. It is his recognition as an adult son, the attaining of his maturity, the seal upon his growth to maturity of mind and character. A child is one born of God; a son is one taught of God. A child has God’s nature; a son has God’s character.”\nAnother aspect of this Greek word, huios, that cannot be overlooked involves “likeness.” The New Testament contains the concept expressed in the proverb, “Like father, like son” (Matt. 5:45,48). It was typical Hebrew usage to employ the word “son” to express likeness. For instance, those who are peacemakers will be called God’s sons because they are like God (Matt. 5:9). God’s likeness, His image, will be “stamped” upon those who have been brought to maturity and adopted as sons (Rom. 8:29; I John 3:2-3).\n\nJesus, the Pattern Son\n\n“ Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given” (Isa. 9:6).\n\nIn the fullness of time, Jesus was born a child in Bethlehem’s manger. Though never relinquishing His divinity, though without sin, Jesus became a man (Phil. 2:5-7). Being a man, He experienced the limitations of humanity, demonstrating for us a way of life under the government of God, always doing the will of the Father (Heb. 10:9). In His humanity, the Scriptures tell us that, “the child continued to grow, and to become strong in the spirit” (Luke 1:80). Hebrews 5:8 states: “Although a Son, He learned obedience through the things that He suffered.” Yet if Jesus never sinned, how could He “learn obedience”? Apparently as Jesus grew toward maturity He, like all human children, was able to take on more and more responsibility. The older He became the more demands His father and mother could place on Him in terms of obedience, and the more difficult the tasks the Heavenly Father could assign. With each increasingly difficult task, even when it involved some suffering (Heb. 5:8), Jesus’ human moral ability, His ability to obey under more and more difficult circumstances, increased. Yet in all this He never sinned (Heb. 4:15). Jesus was finally recognized openly by the Father at His baptism, when the heavens opened and the Heavenly Father declared, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matt. 3:17). This signifies Jesus’ “adoption.” It was now time for Jesus to begin His earthly ministry.\n\nAs a Son, Jesus bore the exact “likeness” of the Father (John 14:9; II Cor. 4:4; Heb. 1:3). He only wanted to do those things that pleased the Father, and He was attentive to the Father’s voice (John 8:28-29). He did not seek His own glory, only the glory of His Father (John 8:50). The Son was not even willing to allow death to stand in the way between Him and His Father’s will. When He faced the prospect of a horrible death on the cross, He plainly did not wish to inflict it upon Himself (Matt. 26:39). But He was willing to endure it, in order to fulfill the Father’s purpose and “because of the joy that was set before Him” (Heb. 12:2). The Father’s will was His overriding motivation.\n\nIn all these things Jesus was the “pattern” for us who desire to be sons of the Father.\n\nSonship and Maturity\n\nThe Bible speaks of sonship both in terms of “positional” and “experiential” truth. For example, some passages relate to the “positional” aspect of sonship, where God declares us legally to be “adopted” as sons through His sovereign election (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 3:26; 4:5-7). The Scriptures do clearly indicate that there is a degree to which we are expected to enter into sonship “experientially,” in this present age ( Matt. 5:9, 45; Rom. 8:14). For instance, we are exhorted in Hebrews 6:1 to “press on to maturity” (i.e.; “sonship”), to think as mature men (I Cor. 14:20), and we are to grow up in all aspects into Him (Ephes. 4:15).\n\nAll of these passages, and numerous others, call us to maturity, which is synonymous with the concept of sonship.\n\nDeVern Fromke, in his book entitled, The Ultimate Intention, makes this comment: “God’s idea is that of ultimate sonship. This involves, as we see, much more than being born into the family; it is rather the full attainment of responsibility which comes to those who have arrived at maturity."

Chao 赵紫宸, one of the most important Chinese theologians and Chinese church leaders in the first half of twentieth century. At the core of Chao’s Christology is the encounter\n\nchinese need to move  ren (eros) to Christian love(agape) through their faith in Jesus Christ. (p98)\nHow may the personality of Jesus Christ be relevant to Chinese people?\nJesus is not only of human model, but also the carrier of human suffring and the consequences of human sin. In the personality of Jesus, there are two subtle and greate elements: one is that the transcendent God lived in his life; the other is that the suffering and sin of humankind was carried on his shoulders. He was both the lovely Son of God and the Savior who bore the pain of humanity.\n(p101)",

        "abstract": "Son preference has persisted in the face of sweeping economic and social changes in the countries studied here. We attribute this persistence to their similar family systems, which generate strong disincentives to raise daughters – whether or not their marriages require dowries – while valuing adult women's contributions to the household. Urbanisation, female education and employment can only slowly change these incentives without more direct efforts by the state and civil society to increase the flexibility of the kinship system such that daughters and sons can be perceived as being more equally valuable. Much can be done to accelerate this process through social movements, legislation and the mass media.\n\n\n\nThe Role of Ancestor Worship In China and South Korea, ancestor worship adds another dimension to the need to have male offspring. In both these countries there are elaborate and explicit beliefs about the afterlife and the need for performing the rituals of ancestor worship in order to ensure the welfare of the departed souls. One’s entire afterlife is at stake: without sons, grandsons and great-grandsons, one’s afterlife is insecure. Not fulfilling one’s filial duty to continue the family line constitutes a major dereliction of duty, and the consequence is that one’s own soul and that of one’s predecessors will become what in China is called ‘hungry ghosts’. This is as important a filial duty as taking care of one’s aged parents – indeed, caring for ancestors is in many ways just an extension of caring for aged parents. To help ensure compliance, there is also a belief that angering the ancestors through unfilial acts can bring their wrath down on you in this life, bringing bad luck. India has less elaborate rituals of ancestor worship, but male descendants are central for ensuring one’s prestige during one’s lifetime and after death, and also for performing a series of funerary rituals. Especially in North-west India, it is very important to achieve immortality in the form of having successfully left descendants to reproduce the social order and carry on one’s family line. Without this, one is recorded in genealogies as the loser whose line died out, or worse still, not recorded at all and therefore condemned to oblivion.",

        "abstract": "China, South Korea and northwest India manifest extreme child sex ratios. This paper argues that this is because their pre-modern political and administrative systems used patrilineages to organise their citizens, generating uniquely rigid patriliny and son preference. It also argues that the advent of the modern state has unravelled the underpinnings of the rigid patriliny, unleashing forces that reduce son preference. Firstly, the modern state has powerful tools for managing its citizenry, rendering patrilineages a threat rather than an asset for the state. Secondly, the modern state has brought in political, social and legal reforms aimed to challenge traditional hierarchies, including those of gender. Thirdly, industrialisation and urbanisation have ushered in new modes of social organisation, which reduce the hold of clans and lineages. Studies suggest that states can accelerate the decline in son preference, through media efforts to help parents perceive that daughters can now be as valuable as sons."

Though dowry and sex selective abortion are the determinants of status of women among the Hindus, they are generally not practiced among the Muslims. However, the lower education status, economic status and social status (due to patriarchy and religious ideologies) respectively and together produce circumstances leading to son being seen as the best socio-economic insurance by the Muslim women. This review of studies conducted on the above topic shows that high fertility among the Muslim women is also a consequence of son preference arising out of socio-economic compulsion in the traditional absence (due to strict religious prohibition) of sex selective abortions."

The demographic effects of family composition are estimated with hazard models. The analysis indicates that son preference fundamentally affects demographic behaviour in India. Family composition affects fertility behaviour in every state examined and son preference is the predominant influence in all but one of these states. The effects of family composition on excess child mortality for girls are more complex, but girls with older sisters are often subject to the highest risk of mortality.",

        "abstract": "PIP:\nIn an interview, Dr. Gu Baochang of China discussed the topics of son preference and the increasing male-to-female sex ratio at birth in China. Gu noted that prior to 1980 the sex ratio in China was normal but that it reached a high of 113.9 in 1989 as fertility dropped. The yearly sex ratio figures continue to be close to normal for first parity births but become increasingly unbalanced for higher order births. The reasons for this abnormal sex ratio at birth are the underreporting of female births (which is estimated to account for 50-75% of the abnormality but is decreasing), sex selective abortion (which is becoming the major factor), and the lesser influence of the infanticide of female babies. The preference for sons which persists in China, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea is determined by the issues of family labor, elderly support, women's status, and carrying on the family line. All of these issues will be influenced by socioeconomic development, which can vary in different regions of a country. Thus, Shanghai has achieved replacement level fertility with a normal sex ratio. Also, to improve efforts at fertility transition, the evaluation of family planning programs should include the incidence of son preference, and the programs should emphasize reproductive health and women's status. The issue of son preference can be explored from a broad perspective by examining the experience of other Asian countries, some of which have normal sex ratios, others of which have excess infant and child mortality. The Chinese government is trying to curb son preference by making efforts to improve the status of women and girls and by banning the illegal use of the sonogram. Eventually, as society evolves and people become achieve economic development, a normal sex ratio and low fertility will be achieved."

        "abstract": "PIP:A paper on the sex ratio at birth in China was presented at the international seminar on China's 1990 population census held during October 19-23, 1992 in Beijing. The normal sex ratio at birth is 106 male births/100 female births, which was the ratio in China in the 1960s and 1970s. However, in 1981 it increased to 108.5, then to 110.9 in 1986, to 111.0 in 1987, and to 113.8 in 1989. The sex ratios at ages 0-4 years were 107.0 in 1953, 106.2 in 1964, 107.1 in 1982, and 110.2 in 1990. The sex ratio at birth in 1989 was 105 for 1st parity births, but reached 120.9, 124.6, and 131.7 for 2nd, 3rd, 4th and higher parity births, respectively. The analysis of data from the 1990 National Census, the 1987 One Percent Population Sample Survey, and the 1988 Two-Per-Thousand Population Sampling Survey revealed that a serious underreporting of female births and increased illegal prenatal sex identification were the most important causes of the increase in the sex ratio at birth. The sex differential in underreporting births accounted for at least 42.6-51.3% of the difference between the normal value of 106 and the actual sex ratio at birth reported in the 1990 census. Data from the 1988 Two-Per-Thousand Population Sampling Survey showed that rate of underreporting of female births twice exceeded that of male births in the years between 1983 and 1988. The underreporting accounted for 54-88% of the difference between the normal value and the reported sex ratios. A great number of B ultrasonic scanning machines were introduced after 1982 in clinics and family planning service stations. Although they are not meant for nonmedical purposes, enforcement of rules is difficult in view of the preference for sons. Medical records of 1,243,284 pregnancies surveyed for birth defects at 945 hospitals indicated sex ratios of 108.0, 108.3, 109.1, and 109.7 in 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991, respectively. Underreporting rather than female infanticide is probably the main cause of these increasing sex ratios. Underreporting, however, has detrimental effects on health care and education and creates an unbalanced population sex structure."

The resultant data are integrated into a widely used and publicly available online database system with browse, search, and visualization functionality. These same results are then aggregated to create a model of text reuse relationships at a corpus level, revealing patterns of systematic reuse among groups of texts. Lastly, the large number of reuse instances identified make possible the analysis of frequently observed string substitutions, which are observed to be strongly indicative of partial synonymy between strings."

Similarity and Difference\nMatteo Ricci’s (1552-1610) The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven was the first in a great line of comparisons between Tian and Yahweh.\n\nAlthough the Classics do not mention heaven or hell, Ricci claims that these teachings were lost in the Burning of the Books in 213 BCE! In the 19th Century, the great Sinologist Legge would use similar methods for similar purposes (see Legge 1865 and 1880). In this section, we shall make some comparisons between Tian and Yahweh which we believe support the Jesuit contention that Yahweh and Tian are alike in being personal and providential but that, at least in the most ancient texts, Yahweh is located within a polytheistic environment (which develops into monotheism) while Tian is more functionally monotheistic in China’s ancient texts.\n[p132]\n Again,an obvious difference between China and the Near East appears: in ancient china, heaven sends a righteous nation to whom the mandate of heaven has been passed to punish a fallen nation; in the Hebrew narratives the nations that God sends against Israel are not righteous and have not received the mandate of heaven; while the Chinese view the conquering nations as successors to the mandate, the Hebrews view the conquering nations as instruments of divine chastisement and punishment with Israel always laying claim to divine favor.\n\nThis raises one of the starkest differences between the two traditions. Yahweh promises to bless the world through Abraham and his descendants and repeatedly reaffirms the covenant with Israel. For better or worse, Yahweh has committed to care for the world through Israel; Yahweh’s commitment to Israel is irrevocable. There are, of course, hills and valleys in the exercise of divine providence through Israel and we leave the Hebrews in the exilic period awaiting their next righteous ruler who will lead them, once again, to the promised land. Jews and Christians will dramatically differ in their understanding of how Yahweh will fulfill his promise to Abraham, but both will agree that Yahweh has determined to bring Yahweh’s will to earth through the children of Abraham. However, Tian makes no such promises. Tian is committed to an ideal of righteousness and wisdom as manifested in a real earthly ruler. Tian will remove his mandate from one ruler (and hence from that ruler’s people) to another ruler (and hence to that ruler’s people). So the mandate of heaven is not the special province of the Zhou (or the Shang or the Xia); it is promised only to those rulers worthy of divine favor and when wickedness prevails the mandate will shift to a new ruler and his people."

China’s "Hermeneutics" came from the study of Chinese classics. It is inherently inseparable from the classics, and this relationship continues all the way to the present. Through comparison between Zhu Xi and Martin Luther, Xu Fuguan and Gadamer, it is not difficult to find that the classics are the core of China’s "Hermeneutics", and thus Hermeneutics would not exist without the study of classics.However, in the West, "philosophical thinking" is the focus of "Hermeneutics", whereas classics is only a "symbol". After further comparison of the innate genetic genes, development environment and the current situation of "Hermeneutics" in China and the West, it can be concluded that "Hermeneutics" should be named "Hermeneutics" in the West, while in China it is more appropriate to be called "classical Hermeneutics"',

        "abstract": '中西方的互动交流使比较研究逐渐成为学术探讨的重点,而孔子和耶稣分别作为中西方传统文化的重要代表,在经济观、政治观、教育观、自然观、生死观等各方面都具备对话的可能。其中,对两者财富观的分析研究既可在价值观层面为人们树立正确、理性看待财富的态度提供借鉴,又能在社会现实层面规范和引导物质财富的运作。在此背景下,孔子与耶稣财富观的比较研究在其各自的现实环境中找到塑成根源的基础上,致力于以下四个问题的解释与处理:财富观的丰富意蕴、财富观的实践方式、财富观的精神面相以及财富观的人学指向,这四个问题分别对应着“是什么”、“怎么样”、“为什么”、“财富与人”的问题,使其在清晰的文本结构中有能力展现更全面的内容,释放更丰富的意义。首先,孔子与耶稣财富观得以产生的现实根基集中于两者生活的时代背景、个人生存经历及其思想渊源三方面。诸侯争战、礼崩乐坏的社会现实,孔子周游列国、开办私学的人生阅历,西周推崇礼制、以德配天的思想传统都对孔子财富观的形成产生了很大影响;政治上的罗马化、文化上的希腊化、信仰上的犹太化在很大程度上也直接塑造了耶稣对待财富的整体态度。其次,阐明孔子与耶稣财富观的丰富意蕴,即意欲解决最本质的“是什么”的问题。孔子与耶稣或儒家与基督教如何界定财富的概念以及财富具有何种特性,是财富观之所以可能的最大实体性前提。财富代表人类所欲求的、对人类有价值的一切东西,所以财富的广义概念使得财富具有物质和精神的双重属性,既可以作为物质实体在现实中具体实践,又有其指向终极关怀的精神面相。这同时直接对应着孔子和耶稣对待财富的具体态度:首先,就财富单纯的物质性来说,静态上的量化不可避免地产生贫穷与富裕的两极定位;但贫穷不是德性的条件,富裕也不是该诅咒的罪恶,贫富选择背后的道德支撑是孔子和耶稣财富观的价值倾向,道德与物质之间的关系正是孔子和耶稣对义与利关系的辩证。再次,比较研究孔子与耶稣财富观的实践方式,即财富作为物质实体如何在现实中彰显、如何发挥其基础性地位、如何在一个生存性世界中运作、如何展现其行动力,即“如何”或“怎么样”的问题。孔子基于阶层划分明显的社会现实,并以其为前提,在“士农工商”四阶层和“天子、诸侯、卿大夫、士、庶人”五阶层的实际操作中落实其财富观;耶稣的财富观却在“圣俗分野”的信仰立场中,从财富的来源和去向(或生产与分配)上保证其成为现世人类生存的物质基础。在此实践过程中,孔子和耶稣的财富观既展现出了立足前提和基本精神上的差异,同时也蕴含着外在行动和内在情感的共通倾向。然后,从财富的精神面相这一角度继续比较孔子与耶稣的财富观。财富的精神面相是指,广义财富概念中最深刻的内涵指向何方,在现实中对物质财富进行运作的信念支撑扎于哪里,这一问题即是“为什么”的问题,是孔子和耶稣财富观的终极关怀问题。孔子财富观以儒家社会的最终理想——“内圣外王”,作为其终极目的,而耶稣把“实现永生与进入上帝之国”作为自己财富观的最终指向,这两种终极关怀作为精神财富完善着财富的广义概念,也作为指路明灯引领着财富在现实世界的物质实践。另外,“内圣外王”与“永生天国”尽管在根本性质和实现方式上不同,但在视财富为工具和致力于各种关系的处理上是相通的智慧。最后,将孔子和耶稣财富观的比较升华至人学,把财富与人联系起来,所以“孔子与耶稣财富观的人学指向”解决的便是何为人、如何为人的问题。人是物质财富和精神财富的结合和矛盾,与财富具有物质属性和精神面相取得一致。然而正如财富的物质属性成为财富的全部内涵一样,人也日益成为只知获取物质财富的机器。但幸运地,人与财富的双重异化状态可在孔子和耶稣的财富观那里找到改善的出路,让财富成为财富,让人成为人,成为自由的人。 Abstract:The interaction between China and the West has made comparative research gradually become the focus of academic discussion.Confucius and Jesus respectively served as the complete presentations of Chinese and Western cultures,have many possibilities of dialogue in economy,politics,education,nature,life and death,and so forth.Among them,the analysis of the Wealth Views can not only provide reference for people to establish a correct and rational attitude towards wealth,but also regulate and guide the operation of material wealth at the level of reality.Against this background,the comparative study of Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views based on the roots of their respective realities,is devoted to the interpretations and treatments of the following four issues: the rich meanings of wealth concept,the practice mode,the spiritual aspects and the humanistic orientation of it.Meanwhile,these four aspects correspond to the question of "what","how","why" and "wealth and human",so that they have a clear text structure to present more comprehensive content,to release more meaning.First of all,the realistic foundations of Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views are concentrated in three points,the background of era,the personal survival experience and their ideological origins.The social reality of the vassal wars and the ruined rituals,Confucius’ life experience of traveling to other nations and opening the private schools,the cultural traditions paying attention to rite and virtue of the Western Zhou Dynasty,have greatly influenced the formation of Confucius’ Wealth View;Largely,the Romanization in politics,the Hellenization in culture and the Judaization in religion,shape Jesus’ Wealth View directly.Secondly,to clarify the rich meanings of Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views,that is,to solve the most essential question of "what".How Confucius and Jesus,or Confucian and Christianity define the concept of wealth and the nature of it,is the greatest substantive prerequisite for the Wealth Views.Wealth can be everything that human beings want and is valuable to them.So,the broad concept of wealth makes it have the dual attributes of material and spiritual.It is practiced as a material entity in reality and has a spiritual aspect that points to ultimate concern.At the same time,it corresponds to Confucius’ and Jesus’ specific attitudes towards wealth: first,in terms of the pure materiality of wealth,static quantification inevitably leads to the polarization of poverty and richness;but poverty is not a condition of virtue,richness is also not the evil of curse.The moral support behind them is the value tendency of Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views,and the relationship between morality and materiality is the dialectical relationship between righteousness and interests.Thirdly,to compare the practice of Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views,that is,how wealth as a material entity manifests itself in reality,how to play its basic position,how to operate in a surviving world,and how to demonstrate its action,namely the question of "how".Confucius,based on the hierarchy,implements his Wealth View in this four-class,"scholar、farmer、worker、merchant",and the five-class,"from the emperor to the common people".Jesus’ Wealth View is to ensure that the wealth can become the material basis for human beings,from the source and direction(or production and distribution)of wealth in the religious position.In this practice,Confucius’ and Jesus’ views of wealth not only show the differences on the premise and the basic spirit,but also include the common tendency of external action and inner emotion.Then,to continue comparing Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views,from the perspective of the spirit of wealth.The spiritual aspect of wealth refers to where the most profound connotation of the concept of general wealth points to,and where the belief in the operation of material wealth is rooted in reality,in other words,the question of "why",the question of ultimate concern.Confucius’ Wealth View regards the ultimate ideal of Confucian society-"Sageliness Within and Kingliness Without",as its final goal,and Jesus’ treats "realizing Eternal Life and entering the Kingdom of God" as its ultimate direction.These two ultimate concerns can enrich the broad concept of wealth as spiritual one,and lead the material practice of wealth in the real world as a guiding light.In addition,although the "Sageliness Within and Kingliness Without" and the "Eternal Life and the Kingdom of God" are different in their fundamental nature and implementation,they are the common wisdom of regarding the wealth as a tool and handling with the various relationships.Finally,to sublimate the comparison between Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views to human studies,and to connect the wealth with human.Therefore,"human studies within the Confucius’ and Jesus’ s Wealth Views " solves the problem of "what is human" and "how to be human".Human is a combination and a contradiction between material wealth and spiritual wealth,and is consistent with the material and spiritual aspects of wealth.However,just as the material nature of wealth becoming the whole connotation of it,human is increasingly being the machines that only pursuing the material wealth.Fortunately,the dual alienation of human and wealth can find a way out of improvement in Confucius’ and Jesus’ Wealth Views,making wealth be wealth,human be human,be free human'

        "abstract": '本文的研究对象是希伯来圣经,即基督教的《圣经·旧约》。其中记载了大量的关于古代以色列人律法和审判方面的信息。通过挖掘和整理这些信息,勾勒出古代以色列审判形态和审判观念的大致图景,复原它们形成与发展的轨迹,并以此为基础,进一步探寻上古民族之审判以及法律实施的真实样态,归纳和总结希伯来圣经中的审判意识形态在当时以及对后世产生的重大影响,是本文主要的研究任务。第一章主要证明希伯来圣经文本作为研究上古时代以色列人审判形态和审判观念之材料的证据效力。早前的研究对希伯来圣经的核心——“摩西五经”的成书年代争议极大,19世纪以来主流的“底本假说”提出,摩西五经是由四种底本组成的,这四个底本分别是:原本(P);第二伊典底本(E);耶典底本(J)和申典底本(D)。但是,关于这四种底本究竟产生于何时,以及四种底本产生的先后顺序,各派百家争鸣,尚未形成统一的观点,但却基本勾定了公元前6世纪为希伯来圣经成书的时代下限。另一方面,底本假说认为,希伯来圣经的原始材料多出自早期历史的记录,因此,希伯来圣经证明古代史实的基本证据效力得以奠定。按照现代人类学的观点,王国出现之前的古代以色列属于酋邦社会,综合考古学的成果,古代西亚—近东早期希伯来人生活的蛛丝马迹进一步证实了希伯来圣经的记载,结合古代姓名的发现、“赫梯条约模式”的分析以及古碑铭学的研究,希伯来圣经的很多记载与真实史实有了更多的印证,从而肯定了希伯来圣经的证据效力,并且显示《申命记》等篇章的证据力更高。第二章开始,进入以色列人审判形态和审判观念的实质研究中。第二章通过分析摩西五经中的信息,重建摩西律法中的审判架构。其中摩西律法的审判原则包括,上帝对以色列人的直接诫命,即“十诫”为审判的根本原则;以审判的公义性为审判的价值原则;以强烈的道德性及保护人身财产权利为审判的具象原则;以及以眼还眼的报复原则。审判制度方面,上帝是至高的审判者,其下包括民族领袖,祭司利未人,各支派中被选出来的官长,以及士师时代的诸位士师、以色列会众,他们都可以成为审判的主体;审判的方法相对简单,常适用巫术和神判;独特的赎罪意识与赔偿制度具有以色列民族特色,此外还有比较详尽的证据规则,初具规模的审判管辖层级和执行制度以及极具特色的“逃城”制度。通过对比分析摩西律法相关规定与《汉穆拉比法典》,可以观察到两者的亲缘关系以及显著差别。造成差别的基础是以色列人独特的信仰观,其律法更加绝对化,也更具人道主义精神。第三章主要描述《约书亚记》与《士师记》中记载的以色列人进军迦南以及士师时代的审判实践。这一时代的主题是征服与激荡。约书亚带领以色列人征服“应许之地”,但随后的士师时代,以色列中满是残酷,杀伐与信仰的衰微。士师的字面含义是审判官,但兼有信仰领袖,军事领导的职责。士师审断案件,以调解为最重要的纠纷解决方法,这可以在现代人类学研究成果中得到相关的解释。通过分析一些具体的案例,可以深化对以色列人审判实践的认识。“埃及人之子案”奠定了属地主义管辖原则,团结和凝聚了危机之中的以色列人。“可拉党人案”展现了上古社会神判的独特意义和特有优势,即塑造审判神圣性,并快速定分止争。“摩押女子引诱案”体现了当时以色列人审判的若干局限性。“亚干案”重现了当时以色列人具体的审判方法和相关程序。此外,在《约书亚记》与《士师记》中出现了圣约与审判的重要关系。圣约是上帝与以色列人订立的约,它是审判的前提,审判是违背圣约的必然后果,而违约与审判是《士师记》最重要的逻辑线。最后,通过对《士师记》中便雅悯事件的分析,可以观察到当时以色列审判的一些具体形制,其在实质上构成了一种审判程序。第四章重点解读《申命记》、申典历史,以及以色列独特的审判意识形态。《申命记》具有特殊性,着重阐述了圣约的概念,具有“赫梯条约”的历史背景。从《申命记》到《列王纪》,可以看到一个非常清晰连贯的叙事逻辑线,而《申命记》就是该逻辑的导言,并由此形成了一种强大的史观,即申典历史观。该历史观认为,上帝是信实的,圣约是至高的,以色列人屡次背叛圣约,招致了亡国灾难。但如以色列人悔改,重新坚定圣约,那么上帝也必将重施恩典,使以色列得以复兴。申典历史观成功解释了以色列过往的所有历史;并告诉以色列人应当如何应对当下的困境;通过申典历史观,以色列人形成了本民族立世的永恒准则:持定上帝,保守圣约。以此为基础,以色列人建立起了自己的审判意识形态。这种意识形态包括审判的前提,即公义、严厉的审判者。审判的基础,即罪与罪之代价。审判的标准,即确定与公义的法。以色列审判意识形态强调,个人终将被置于上帝的审判之下。上帝公义,罪恶必要偿付,审判也绝不会缺席。通过审判,恩典的应许和惩罚的警诫得以兑现,并最终落实律法。结语主要总结了希伯来圣经中的审判所形成的影响。这些影响包括古代文明时期、中世纪和近现代三个阶段。希伯来圣经中的审判在古代早期文明中具有重要地位,其与楔形文字法和古埃及法既存在深厚的历史联系,又存在显著不同,具有强烈的以色列特色,体现出文明发展早期阶段审判的一般特征。希伯来圣经中的审判在中世纪对基督教教会法和伊斯兰教审判都产生了重要的影响,这种影响主要是通过宗教教义的传承施加的。进入近现代,希伯来圣经中的审判对现代审判文化仍然起到一定的塑造作用。其已经内化为一种文化因子,嵌入西方文化的背景中。“最后的审判”代表了欧美文化的一种思维方式:行恶之人必须接受正义的审判,并通过审判承受应得的惩罚。在实质层面,其也对现代司法审判产生了若干影响,例如近代检察权的产生,以及对现代审判中宣誓制度的塑造等。通过研究,可以认定希伯来圣经中的审判具有重要的意义,它不仅是学者们认识古代文明审判样态的珍贵样本,也是理解审判意识形态和现代法治文明的重要媒介,同时还具有无尽的文化价值,因此是一笔宝贵的法律文化财富。Abstract:Hebrew Bible, which named Old Testament in Christianity, is the object of study in this research. Hebrew Bible recorded a lot of information about the law and trial practices of early ancient Israelites. By digging and researching these information, it could be possible that roughly outline the situation of the trial practices and relevant ideas of ancient Israelites, and by investigating the track of formation and development of the situation, further discovery of authentic law and law enforcement in early ancient times will be realized. To conclude the ideology of trial and judgment in the Hebrew Bible and summary its major influence on future generations is a main task of this research as well.The target of the first chapter is to examine the virtue of the Hebrew Bible text as an evidence from studies on the trial practices and ideology of trial and judgment of Israelites in ancient times. Previous studies made many controversies about the written time of the core of the Hebrew Bible, which named Pentateuch. Documentary Hypothesis, which is the mainstream theory since the 19 th century put forward that the Pentateuch is made up of four original documents, which were: Priestly Source(P), Elohist Source(E), Yahwist(J) and Deuteronomist(D). However, the exact time that the documents be written and the sequencing of four documents were still controversial and there was no unanimous opinion, but Documentary Hypothesis basically had found the latest time period which the Hebrew Bible be accomplished, 6th century BC. On the other hand, Documentary Hypothesis also believed that the Hebrew Bible’s original materials could stem from some early history records, therefore, the fundamental evidential virtue of the Hebrew Bible could be acknowledged. In the view of modern anthropology, the ancient Israel society before the first kingdom be founded belong to a kind of chiefdom society, and by the archaeological discovery involving the early Hebrews’ lives in ancient West Asia and Near East, some records in the Hebrew Bible could be further confirmed. Combined with the discovery of ancient name, analysis of the Hittite Treaty pattern and research on ancient epigraphy, the records in Hebrew Bible could be verified by the ancient historical facts more and more, consequently the evidential virtue of the Hebrew Bible text could be further certified, and some books, like Deuteronomy, have more weight-of-evidence.A substantive research on the trial practices and ideology begins with the second chapter, which rebuilds a trial framework in Mosaic Law through analyzing the information in Pentateuch. Firstly, the trial principles in Mosaic Law could be concluded. The Decalogue, which means God’s direct commandments to Israelites, is the prime principle of trial. The righteousness of judgment is the value principle. A strong sense of morality and protection of property and personal rights are the specific principles, as well as the principle of Talionic Punishment. Secondly, in regard to trial systems, the adjudicators include God, who is the supreme one, and under God, the leaders of people, priests the Levites, officers who were elected in each tribes, and then the judges in the Judges Age, as well as the congregation of Israel. The methods to make judgments are relatively simple. Witchcraft and Ordeals were often applied. An unique sense of atonement as well as the compensation system had characteristics of Israelites. The rules of evidence were detailed, a multilevel jurisdiction was formed, and the implementation of judgments and the systems of Cities of Refuge were especially featured. Finally, through comparative analysis of the relevant provisions of Mosaic Law and Code of Hammurabi, it can be observed that there was a genetic relationship between them and many significant differences as well. The differences were caused by the special faith of Israel, which made the law of Israel be more absolute and had more humanitarian spirit.The third chapter describes the trial practices from the time Israelites conquered Canaan until they built kingdom. This chapter focuses on Book of Joshua and Book of Judges, which narrate a very turbulent and agitated time period. Joshua led the Israelites to conquer the Promised Land, and then in the Judges Age, there were so many brutalities and slaughters among the Israel people, and their faith declined seriously. As the literal meaning, the judges were adjudicators, who may be leaders of faith or had powers to command armies as well. When judges heard cases, mediation was the most important method to solve disputes, which can be interpreted by modern anthropological theory. Through the analysis of some specific cases,the understanding of the trial practices of Israelites maybe deepened. The case of the Egyptian’s son established the territorial jurisdiction, which helped the Israel people to be united and cohesive during the crisis time. The case of Korahites demonstrated an unique advantage and significance of ordeal in early ancient society, which cultivated the sacredness of trials and judgments, and quickly solved disputes. The case of Moabitess reflected some limitations of the Israelites’ trial. The case of Achan demonstrated some specific methods and procedures of the trials in Israel people. In addition, the important relationship between Holy Covenant and judgment can be observed in Book of Joshua and Book of Judges. The Holy Covenant is an agreement between God and Israelites and was a prerequisite for the judgment to Israelites. The judgment was an inevitable result from Israelites’ breach of the Covenant. And the breach as well as the following judgment are the most important logic lines in Book of Judges. Finally, through an analysis on the Benjamin incident in Book of Judges, it can be investigated that some institutions, which would make procedures essentially, emerged in the trials of Israel people.The fourth chapter interprets Book of Deuteronomy, Deuteronomic History and the unique ideology of trial and judgment of Israelites. Book of Deuteronomy is special and focuses on the concept of Holy Covenant, which had some historical background to the Hittite Treaty. A very clear and coherent narrative logic line emerged from Book of Deuteronomy to Book of Kings, and Deuteronomy is the 4introduction of the logic, thus a powerful view of history formed, which named Deuteronomic History. Deuteronomic History believes that God is faithful, and Holy Covenant is the highest. The Israelites come to be conquered and destroyed was a result from they repeatedly betrayed the Covenant. However, if Israelites repent and take hold of Holy Covenant again, God will bless and give grace to Israetites again as well, and then the Israel people will be revived. Deuteronomic History successfully explained all the past history of Israelites, and told the people how to deal with the plight of the moment. Israelites found a kind of eternal guideline for the whole nation via Deuteronomic History, which is, just believe in God and take hold of the Covenant. Then on this basis, Israelites established their own ideology of trial and judgment, which included the followings. An adjudicator who should be righteous and severe, and this is the precondition of judgment. The concept of sin and its retribution, and this is the basis of judgment. In addition, a set of law that should be certain and righteous, and this is the standard of judgment. The ideology of trial and judgment of Israelites emphasized that everyone would be placed under God’s judgment eventually, the judgment would never be absent, and everyone should pay for his evil doing because of God’s righteousness. God’s promise of grace and caution of punishment would be realized, by the judgment, the law of God would be fulfilled finally.The epilogue summarizes the impacts of the trials and judgment in Hebrew Bible. The impacts had covered three periods, namely the early ancient period, the medieval age and the modern times. The trials and judgment in Hebrew Bible played an important role in the early ancient civilizations. It can be observed that the trials and judgment in Hebrew Bible which reflected the general characteristics of trials in early ancient civilizations, had historical ties to the ancient Egyptian Law and Cuneiform Law, on the other hand, however, significant differences existed between them, because of the strong features of Israelites. In the medieval age, the trials and judgment in Hebrew Bible have had important influences on the Canon Law of Christianity and on the trials of Sharia Law in Islam. The influences imposed mainly through the religious doctrines. In the modern times, the trials and judgment in Hebrew Bible has been cultivating the modern trial culture to a certain extent. The essences in Hebrew Bible have been internalized as cultural elements, and embedded in the western culture background. The idea of Last Judgment represents a distinctive way of thinking in European and American culture, which means a person who did evil must be placed under the just judgment and bears deserved punishment via the judgment. On the substantive level, the trials in Hebrew Bible resulted in a number of impacts on the modern judicial system as well, for example, the generation of modern prosecutorial power, the formation of oath system in modern tribunal and so forth.It can be confirmed that the trials and judgment in Hebrew Bible have significant status through the research. They are not only the precious samples for the scholars to recognize the trials in early ancient times, but also important media to understand the ideology of judgment and modern legal civilization. And they have tremendous cultural values, and thus can be regarded as invaluable legal cultural treasures. ',

"中国的基督教社会主义与拉丁美洲解放神学是基督教社会主义的两种类型,二者关注的问题有许多重合之处,中国基督教社会主义理论及实践的集中发展阶段为二十世纪初至60年代前期,而拉美解放神学形成于60年代末期,其诞生的标志为古铁雷斯的名著《解放神学》的发表。因此本文旨在论证中国是否先于拉美就有了属于自身的解放神学。本文第一章追溯了基督教社会主义这一概念的形成过程。形成于旧约时代的圣经经文从摩西五经到大小先知书均充满了对于穷人的怜悯和对正义的宣扬,甚至预表了社会主义社会中的平等与按劳分配的理念;形成于新约时代的四福音书与使徒保罗的书信中也蕴含着类似于社会主义的劳动就业观、产权观与民主观念的雏形。早期教父时代的东西方教父们不但坚持圣经固有的穷人立场,奥古斯丁等人还倡导在生活中践行原始的共产主义模式。中世纪神学家阿奎那在产权、财富和收入分配及价格方面的表述颇具现代社会主义社会的特征。16世纪托马斯·莫尔在基督教氛围浓厚的欧洲发表了《乌托邦》,开创了近代空想社会主义,也是整个社会主义思想和实践的第一阶段。与莫尔同时代的托马斯·闵采尔开创了最初的基督教社会主义传统,尽管当时他使用了暴力革命的方式,“基督教 Abstract:Chinese Christian Socialism and Latin American Liberation Theology are two types of Christian Socialism and have many common concerns.The theory and practice of Chinese Christian Socialism were mainly developed from the beginning of the 20’s century to 1960’s.Liberation Theology was basically formed at the end of 1960’s and was marked by the publishing of Gutierrez’s Liberation Theology.The purpose of this dissertation is to argue whether China has already had its own Liberation Theology prior to Latin America.The first chapter focused on the evolution of Christian Socialism.From Torah to The Prophets,the Old Testament was full of mercy for the poor and exaltation for the justice.It even anticipated the Socialist ideas of equality and distribution according to one’s performance.From the four gospels to Paul’s Epistles,the New Testament was also filled with early Socialist thoughts on employment,property and democracy.Early Church Fathers,no matter Western or Eastern,held on to Biblical preference for the poor.Augustine even promoted primitive Communism in daily life.Aquinas’s interpretation on property,wealth,distribution of income as well as price had the characteristics of modern Socialist society.Thomas More published Utopia in the 16’s century when Europe was still immersed in Christian atmosphere.He set up the tradition of Utopian Socialism which was first stage of the entire Socialist theory and practice.Thomas Munzter started the real history of Christian Socialism in the 16’s century as well although he adopted violent revolution and the name of Christian Socialism has not come out yet.Jacob Hutter who was an Anabaptist like Munzter,inherited selectively the Christian Socialist tradition created by him but transformed it into non-violent form.It was later spread to North America and preserved as the Hutterites and the Menonnites until today.Jean Jacques Rousseau and Henri de Saint-Simon further developed the theories related to Socialism and established the foundations for the ultimate birth of the concept of Christian Socialism.The name of Christian Socialism was eventually given by British priests Kingsley and Maurice who founded the Christian Socialism for the improvement of Capitalism.Similarly in the 19th century the other two types of Christian Socialism,one for the lower class people and the other for monks,could also be found.The second chapter introduced the historical and modern context for LiberationTheology and the basic views of the Father of Liberation Theology Gutierrez and the Argentine Liberation Theologian Bonino.The relationship between Liberation Theology and Christian Socialism was also recalled.Liberation Theology was launched by Catholics as a kind of Christian Socialism and it influenced Protestants as well.It supported earthly justice among the people elected by God and concentrated on the experience and efforts of the poor who fought for liberation.Liberation Theologians expected a theology which could be put into the practice for liberation,thus introduced the social and economic theories of Marxism as the tool for analysis along with the theological reflection.There existed the tradition of Jesus as the Liberator throughout Christian History although new meanings had been constantly reinterpreted.It encouraged the human struggle for liberation.The European Christian Socialism deeply affected Liberation Theology and the latter also provided nutrition for the former.The impact of Christian Socialism could also be seen in European Party Politics and this was described in the last part of the second Chapter.The third chapter looked into Chinese Christian Socialism from the perspective of Liberation Theology,compared the Christian history of both China and Latin American and presented the evolution of Chinese Christian Socialism and its key figures.Chinese Christian Socialism was originated in the first half of the 20th century.It was an indigenized Christian Socialism which absorbed Marxian Socialism and Christian Socialism for the improvement of Capitalism,and adopted the discourse system of Confucianism.Its key figures in early stage included Shen Sizhuang and Zhang Shizhang.Later representatives like Zhu Weizhu,Wu Leichuang and Wu Yaozong all made theoretic contribution to the development of Chinese Christian Socialism.The fourth chapter attached more importance to the common concerns of the two types of Christian Socialism,which included the Christian Revolutionary consciousness,the relationship between Christians and Politics,the cooperation between Christians and Marxists,the church of the people,socialist transformation,class struggle,religious criticism,humanist views etc.The difference of the above two in these shared areas such as the way of expression,the path,levels of degree and chronological order was also pointed out.This chapter also indicated the reasons for the existence of similarities and distinctiveness.Finally,it was concluded that China had developed its indigenized Christian Socialism prior to Latin America which was in fact a predating of Liberation Theology"

        "abstract": "比较研究是宗教学的主要进路之一。犹太-儒学比较研究是最近二十年来兴起的研究方向,本文选取“先知”与“圣人”这两个重要角色作为个案,在古代犹太教和儒家经典的范围内,运用比较研究的方法展开分析。比较研究首先以厘清比较对象的内涵为基础。我们对于“先知”的理解往往集中于“预先知晓”或“预告”等功能,其实这是始自希腊语翻译的一种误解。同时,汉语语境中对“先知”的认知在很大程度上依赖于基督教,难免也受到其意识形态的影响。我们从犹太教的经典(圣经和《塔木德》)出发,重新理解“先知”的4个不同名号以及犹太传统的“先知”界定,揭示出先知主要作为上帝“代言人”的角色;“圣人”长期以来被视为儒家最高级别的理想人格,这种理解导致“圣人”成为一个虚体的概念,失去了其本有的鲜活角色意义。通过从字形演变、传世经典和出土资料等方面对“圣”进行溯源考察和重新思考,我们厘清“圣”经历了一个从出众的“听”“说”等感官能力到超绝的“智慧”理性能力,最终演变为一种儒家美德的过程。儒家“圣人”即被视为具备了这些能力和美德的杰出人物。聚焦于智慧、美德等维度来理解“圣人”,导致对其所本有的感官能力、宗教意义有所忽视。从宗教性的角度来重新认识“圣人”,有助于更加深刻地把握古代儒学的文化品格。比较分析“先知”与“圣人”的源流与解释传统可知,“先知”与“圣人”作为重要的人物角色,同时具有历史真实和经典意义的双重维度,而古代犹太教和儒家经典更为注重从信仰的角度突出他们的重要性。比较研究可以有多元化的进路,我们从三个方面进行先知与圣人之间的“互鉴式”解读。首先,不同文明之间相向进行的经典翻译是反映双方相互认知和理解程度的重要载体,考察“互译”过程中出现的意义流失,可以为比较研究提供一个新的视角。希伯来“先知”和儒家“圣人”都可以通过经典翻译来发现对方的理解:儒家经典中的“先知”概念是中文《圣经》(?)/Prophet译名所借助的本土文化资源,而英文、希伯来文则使用《圣经》中的Sage/(?)来对译“圣人”。翻译即理解,然而结合这些角色概念在各自传统中的定位来看,这种“互译”都没有准确传达出概念的本义,从而构成了产生误解的根源。其次,对摩西和孔子进行“互鉴式解读”,是继概念厘定和译名辨正之后所进行的具体人物角色对比。“最伟大的先知”摩西和“集大成者”孔子,作为犹太传统中“先知”和儒家“圣人”的典范代表,二者的身份和地位具有相似性。然而,二者在各自传统中却有着不同的历史序列定位,孔子是儒家圣人传统的“终结者”,而摩西被奉为先知传统的“启动者”。最后,在“互鉴式解读”的过程中,我们不回避那些标识了犹太传统中“先知”和儒家传统“圣人”的文化独特性,例如与先知相关的“预言”概念、真假先知判断等问题,以及儒家“圣人”作为最高的人格典范意义,在对方传统中都无法找到对应的比较点。我们认为,这种“不可比性”彰显了“先知”与“圣人”的文化特性,同样是比较研究的必要组成部分。无论从历史还是经典来看,“先知”与“圣人”都不仅仅是理性的伦理倡导者,他们同时也承续了各自传统中的宗教(性)因素。一方面,先知与圣人都担负着沟通超验的终极存在与世俗生活之间“中保”的角色和职责。先知的“中保”意义主要体现为先知是上帝的“传言人”,将上帝的话语传达给以色列人;同时他又是神人之间的“调解者”,站在民众的立场上,从民众的利益出发,代表民众与上帝商讨,为民请命;圣人的“中保”意义则体现在圣人被视为与“天”沟通的唯一渠道,“圣人”是“天道”的知晓者和传达者,传达“天道”以实现对民众的教化。其不同在于,先知只能原样传达上帝的话语,而圣人在悟晓“天道”时融合了自身的学识和人生经验,因而存在更多自由发挥的空间。另一方面,先知与圣人都与各自传统中的宗教角色之间有着密切关联。先知与祭司并非始终决然对立,在犹太传统看来,先知的伦理主张和部分先知同时具有的祭司身份,反映出来二者之间存在的和谐关系;早期儒家经典中可见大量“圣人”作为神秘宗教角色的叙事,研究还揭示出“圣人”与“巫”之间存在承继脉络,“巫”乃“圣人”之原型,古代儒学的宗教性因素不容忽视。揭示先知、圣人的宗教渊源及其与宗教传统之间的继承性关系,是对理性主义“文明突破论”主张的有力回应。任何宗教都需要外在规范,以表达其内在价值理念。希伯来先知与儒家圣人作为各自传统中“价值”的主要传达和阐述者,他们面对这种内-外之间的张力关系,作出了各自的回应。犹太教的外在规范主要表现为律法以及其中包含的宗教礼仪,一般认为先知与这些外在规范之间是对立互斥的关系,表现出鲜明的贬低律法-礼仪的倾向。研究表明,犹太传统始终主张先知与律法的一致性,古代犹太教经典传达出“先知是律法的忠实传承者和解释者”这一观念。我们认为,先知的伦理批判并非指向律法-礼仪本身,而是倡导一种适宜的信仰表达形式;流放归来的先知更加积极地支持律法-礼仪,以获取凝聚人心的积极作用。儒学的外在规范主要表现为礼乐文化形式,礼乐制度来自于“圣人”对天地运作秩序的观察与效仿,“圣人”被视为儒家礼乐的创制者;孔子虽然应仍时代处境实现了对礼乐文化的转化,但是他并未彻底拒绝和摒弃礼乐,“述而不作”同样成就了孔子的“圣人”地位。先知之于律法,纵然无法与儒家“圣人”的制作之功相媲美,但是他们与孔子继承并转化礼乐的主张在本质上是相通的。先知与圣人的这种主张表明,追求实现内在价值与外在规范之间的统一,而非“非此即彼”的武断立场,才是继承和发展传统的有益路径。政治是宗教在世俗领域的延伸,这在古代世界尤为显著。“先知”与“圣人”都被视为古代犹太教和早期中国政治叙事的重要参与者。先知(撒母耳)见证了古代以色列君权的建立,曾先后膏立最早的两位君王,表明君权来自神授及其合法性。先知参与建立的政权新模式是一种“有限君主制”,君王的权力受到先知的严格监督,君王只能在信仰上帝的基础之上进行统治,否则将会遭到来自先知的批判。先知的政治参与始终围绕着宗教信仰而展开,崇信上帝是先知政治参与的起点、依赖与旨归。儒家“圣人”在思考政权来源时追溯至“天”,周公致力于论证政权更迭是因为亡国统治者失德,导致“天命转移”,惟有德者才能获得“天”的青睐与护佑;“德”而非对“天”、“天命”的信仰成为了更为根本的决定力量。“圣人”与政权之间关系中的“圣王”、“德治”以及谏诤等概念,均与“敬德”有关。因此,从超验信仰的角度来追问政权来源及其合法性,“先知”与“圣人”表现出极大相似性,二者都是旨在为人间世俗政治秩序寻找一个超验的价值源头,所不同的是,先知始终贯彻“信仰优先”,而儒家圣人在政治参与过程中阐发出“道德至上”的新准则,由此为儒学铺就了一种人文底色。本文在犹太-儒学比较研究的视域下,通过溯源“先知”和“圣人”的本义,从犹太传统出发重新认识和思考“先知”,从宗教角度重新思考“圣人”的功能和意义,并通过经典互译、“互鉴式”解读等多元方式,思考并推进比较研究的方法论建设。在此基础上,进而系统地展示了传统经典中“先知”与“圣人”在宗教渊源、价值表达、政治参与等共同议题中相同而又别具特色的应对方式,尤其注重从宗教学的视角重新思考二者对于传统和人类文明的意义,以期在此基础上推进两种传统之间的相互认知与彼此理解,为文明对话提供理论基础。 Abstract:Comparative study is one of the main approaches of researching in religious studies. Judaic-Confucian comparative study is a new branch which has risen within the recent two decades. The current research chooses two important roles, Hebrew Prophet and Confucian Sage, as a case study, analyzing these two concepts using comparative study method within the sphere of ancient Judaism and Confucian classics.The basis of comparative study is to firstly clarify the connotations of the objects of the comparison. Our understanding of 'prophet' has always been focused on its function such as 'to know beforehand'’ or 'forecast',however, this is a misunderstanding due to the Greek translation. At the same time, the cognition towards 'prophet' in Chinese largely relies on Christianity, hence inevitably influenced by Christian ideology. This research will start with ancient Jewish classics(Hebrew Bible and Talmud), try to understand the four names of 'prophet' and the definition of 'prophet' according to the Jewish tradition, reveal the main role of prophet as God’s 'spokesman'. 'Sage' has long been seen as the highest level of an ideal personality in Confucianism. This understanding of 'sage' makes it an insubstantial concept, which causes the loss of its original vivid meaning. By means of analyzing the evolvement of its character pattern, taking advantage of the ancient classics and making use of archaeological materials, this research will trace the origins of 'sacred' and reconsider its meaning. We further clarify the process of“sacred' which develops from outstanding sense ability to transcendent wisdom,eventually to Confucian virtue. Confucian sages are luminaries who possess these abilities and virtues. Understanding 'sage' by focusing on aspects such as wisdom and virtue will result in the negligence of the sense ability and religious meaning of a sage. Approaching 'sage' from religious angle would help us grasp the cultural character of ancient Confucianism more profoundly. Comparing the origins and the interpretation traditions of 'prophet' and 'sage' will tell us that as important roles,'prophet' and 'sage' are not only historical roles,but also have meanings in classics.In addition, ancient Judaism and Confucian classics also emphasize their importance in the aspect of faith.There are diversified approaches of comparative study, this research will interpret 'prophet' and 'sage' by comparing these two concept in three aspects through mutual reference. Firstly, mutual translation of classics of different culture is an important way to reflect the extent of mutual cognition and comprehension.Investigating the loss of meaning during mutual translation provides us a new perspective for comparative studies. Hebrew 'prophet' and Confucian 'sage' can both be comprehended by translating each other’s classics: the term 'Xianzhi' in the Chinese version bible may come from the same word of the Confucian classics , it’s a use of local cultural material;and in English as well as in Hebrew, Sage/(?) is used as a translation for the concept of 'Sheng-ren'. Translation is actually a form of comprehension and interpretation, however, combined with the orientation of these roles and concepts within their own tradition, this kind of mutual translation unfortunately does not convey their original meaning, hence leaves roots for further misunderstanding. Secondly,the 'mutual interpreting' of Moses and Confucius is a comparison of specific characters following clarification of the concepts and their transitions. 'The greatest prophet' Moses and Confucius who 'epitomized Confucianism', they are typical representatives of the prophet in Jewish tradition and the sage in Confucianism, and they have similar roles as well as status in these two cultures respectively. However, these two characters possess different historical significance: Confucius was the 'terminator' of Confucian tradition, while Moses was considered the 'initiator' of prophetic tradition. Lastly,in the process of “mutual interpretation',we will not avoid the cultural uniqueness that mark 'prophet' in Jewish tradition and 'sage' in Confucian tradition. The current research suggests that this kind of 'incomparability' actually manifests the cultural distinctiveness of'prophet' and 'sage',which is a necessary component of comparative studies.No matter from the historical point of view or form the viewpoint of classics,'prophet' and 'sage' are not only the advocators of rational ethics, but also the successors of religious elements of their own tradition. On the one hand, both prophet and sage carry the role and responsibility as the 'mediator' of communicating transcendent ultimate existence with mundane life. The role of prophet as the'mediator' mainly reflects on the fact that a prophet is the “spokesman' of God,conveying God’s words to Israelites; in the meantime, he is also the 'intercessor',who stands at the same standpoint with his people, thinks of the interest of the common people, represents his people to negotiate with God, pleads for the people.The role of sage as the 'mediator' reflects on the fact that a sage is considered the only channel through whom people can communicate with 'Tian', 'sage' understands and conveys 'Tian-dao',educate people by conveying 'Tian-dao' The difference is that the prophet can only pass on God’s words as they were, whereas when the sage conveys 'Tian-dao', he could integrate it with his own knowledge and life experience,thus has more freedom to perform. On the other hand, both the prophet and the sage are tightly connected to the religious roles in their own tradition. The prophet and the priest has not been always contradict definitely to each other, according to the Jewish tradition, the ethical claims of the prophet are the same with those of the priest, and some of the prophets themselves play the same roles of priests, all of which reflect the harmonious relationship between prophets and priests. There are lots of narratives describing 'sage' acting as mysterious religious character in early Confucian classics;there are also research revealing the lineage between 'sage' and “shaman': 'shaman'is the prototype of 'sage',which suggests that we cannot neglect the religious elements of ancient Confucianism. Revealing the inheriting relationship between the religious source of prophet and sage and their religious tradition forms a powerful response to the so-called 'civilization breakthrough theory' of rationalism.Every religion needs external criterion, so as to express its internal value idea.Hebrew prophet and Confucian sage as the main transmitter and interpreter of their own tradition, they offered their own response when facing this internal-external tension. The external criterion of Judaism mainly appears as the law and the religious ritual within the law. It is generally recognized that sage and these external criterion contradict each other, and sages usually have the tendency of belittle the law especially ritual. Study shows that Jewish tradition has always advocated the consistency of prophets and the law,ancient Judaism classics conveys the idea that'prophet is the loyal transmitter and interpreter of the law'. This research suggests that the ethical criticism of prophets does not point to the law and ritual, instead, it advocates an appropriate expression form of faith; especially, those prophets who have been through exile actually support the law and ritual more actively, in order to achieve the positive result of bringing people together and increasing cohesion. The external criterion of Confucianism mainly appears as rite and music culture. Rite and music institutions come from the 'sage' observes and follows the example of the law and the order of Heaven,'sage' has been considered as the creator of Confucian rite and music; Even though Confucius accomplished the transformation of rite and music culture according to contemporary condition, he did not deny and give up rite and music completely, 'passing on the ancient culture without adding anything new to it' made Confucius achieve the status of 'sage'. The relationship between prophet and the law cannot compete with 'sage' and his creation,but prophets are in essence the same with Confucius inheriting then transforming rite and music. The proposition of prophet and sage shows that the unity of perusing internal value and external criterion,not 'one or another/either or' position,is the helpful approach of inheriting and developing tradition.Politics is an extension of religion in the secular sphere, which is especially notable in the ancient world. 'Prophet' and 'sage' are considered as the important participator of political narration of ancient Judaism and early China. Prophet Samuel witnessed the formation of ancient Israel monarchical power, he also anointed the earliest two kings to demonstrate the legitimacy of the monarchical power and that the monarchical power comes from God. This new model of the prophet who participate the formation of regime is a kind of 'limited monarchy', which means the power of the monarch is strictly supervised by the prophet, the monarch can only rule on the basis of believing in God, or else he will be criticized by the prophet. The political participation of the prophet has always launched around religious belief, believing in God is the starting point, dependence as well as the purpose of the prophet’s political participation. When Confucian “sage' thought about political power,he traced it back to 'Heaven' the Duke of Zhou devoted to demonstrate that the regime change is because of the loss of ethics and virtue of its ruler, which leads to the 'transformation of destiny',and only individuals with virtue could acquire favor and protection of the'Heaven'. The Belief of 'virtue' instead of 'Tian' or 'Tian-ming' became the most fundamental deciding force. “Sage' and the concept within political power such as'sage ruler','rule of virtue' and 'frank criticism',are all related to the concept of'respecting the morality'. Therefore, from the perspective of transcendent faith to inquire the origin and legitimacy of a regime,the concept of 'prophet' and 'sage'shows tremendous similarity, both of them aim at looking for a transcendent value source for the secular political order; the difference is that the prophet has always carried out the rule of 'faith first',whereas Confucian sage has raised a new rule of'the supremacy of moral value',which paved a humanistic foundation for Confucianism.By conducting a comparative study, the current research will search for the original meanings of 'prophet' and 'sage',reveal the similar and distinctive response of 'prophet' and 'sage' from classics in regard to religious origins, value expressions and political participation, especially focus on rethinking the meaning of these two concept on tradition and human civilization from a religious perspective, in the hope of advancing the cognition and comprehension between these two traditions, further providing the theoretical basis of dialogue between civilizations."

        "abstract": "《圣经》本身是一部集合宗教、历史、文学等多种属性于一身的文化经典,在以多元化为特征的现代文化语境中圣经研究获得了丰富的研究视角,而伴随比较文学的兴起,圣经研究又进入了跨学科、跨文化的交叉比较研究。本文是一部以传记理论为支撑对《圣经·旧约》进行系统研究的论文,它通过以中国古代及现代传记理论与作品为参照,在对《旧约》各经卷的具体分析、对《旧约》的整体关照基础上探讨《旧约》具有的传记性特征。围绕《旧约》的传记性特征,论文分为绪论、正文和余论三部分,正文又再分为三编来具体分析《旧约》与传记特征的具体联系。绪论主要介绍了三方面的内容：一是回顾圣经文学性研究以及传记特征研究的现状,二是介绍《旧约》中传记性的存在,三则是探讨《旧约》传记性的生成。第一编是对《旧约》中各个传记范畴的讨论。本编分为三章。第一章讨论《旧约》的传记维度,以朱东润传记理论为依据分别探讨《旧约》中的“真实”、“艺术”和“个性”三维度以及历史与文学之间的紧密联系,从而论证《旧约》的传记属性。第二章对《旧约》中的传记类别进行分析,论述了《旧约》中的人物传记、族群传记和自传类别。第一节论述《旧约》叙事呈现的人物传记特征,《旧约》中的人物传记作品及其分类,最后是《旧约》所塑造的传主类型及类特征。第二节和第三节的内容将犹太族看作一个独立主体,分别探讨了《旧约》作为族群传记与自传的文本属性。第三章讨论了《旧约》传记写作整体上的宗教化特征,探讨有关宗教特征的生成机制、宗教性因素对传记写作的渗透等内容。第二编介绍了《旧约》关于族群意识的探索,是对《旧约》传记文本思想主题的总体关照。第一章论述了《旧约》对犹太族群历史的梳理,从该族群历史的叙述中我们得以描绘出“犹太人”的族群形象以及犹太族群意识的形成。第二章转而从《旧约》编订者的内部视角切入,探讨犹太人编纂《旧约》的族群意义及其重写犹太历史、理想化族群形象的过程。第三编针对《旧约》对他者意识的洞察进行探讨。第一章从正面论述了不同历史时期的“耶和华”形象对犹太族群性的反映,以及这位圣洁之神作为“他者”形象对其国民性塑造的指导意义,第二章则从反面论述了犹太族为建构自我理想镜像所塑造的异族、异神等“他者”形象,这一部分还涉及到其他通过强调“他者”对立来扩展自我的手段。论文的余论部分探讨了《旧约》传记特征对《新约》叙事、圣徒传记以及后世传记写作的影响,重点介绍了中世纪圣徒传记的发展历史与写作特征。 Abstract:The Holy Bible is a cultural classic with manifold attributes of religion, history, literature, and so on. The modern context characterized by cultural pluralism has triggered a profusion of approaches to the study of the Bible. With comparative literature into vogue, the biblical study has evolved into an interdisciplinary and intercultural scholarship. This paper, based on biographical theories, is intended to make a systematic research into the Old Testament. With reference to classical and contemporary biographic theories and works in China, this dissertation explores the biographical features of the Old Testament with concrete analysis of each volume and global consideration of the whole book. Focusing on biographical features, the paper is divided into three parts-introduction, main body and further discussion,.The introduction is devoted to the literature review of the literary and the biographical research of the Bible, the presence and the generation of the biographical features of the Old Testament.The main body, composed of three parts, demonstrates the association between the Old Testament and biographical features.Part I exhibits the biography categories in the Old Testament in three chapters. The first chapter is concerned with the biographical dimensions in the Old Testament. On the basis of Zhu Dongrun’s biographical theory, the chapter discusses the three dimensions of reality, art and individuality as well as the close relationship between history and literature so as to expound on the biographical attributes of the Old Testament.The second chapter is an exposition of the three biographical types in the Old Testament-the biography of individuals, the biography of ethnic groups, and the autography. The first section is about the narrative features, the specific works and the classification on the part of the biographies of individuals as well as the types of heroes and their common traits in the Old Testament while the second and the last sections, deeming the Jews as an independent case, probe into the text attribute of the Old Testament as the biography of ethnic groups and the autography.The third chapter centers on the religious attribute of the whole text, the generative mechanism of the religious attribute, and the penetration of the religious elements into the biographical writing.PartⅡ, an investigation of the ethnic consciousness in the Old Testament, concerns the cardinal theme of the biography in a global view. The first chapter traces the history of the Jewish ethnic groups presented in the Old Testament so as to reveal the Jewish images and the formation of the Jewish ethnic consciousness. Starting from the angle of the compilers, the second chapter discloses the ethic significance of the Jews’ compiling the Old Testament and the process of rewriting the Jewish history to idealize Jewish people.PartⅢinvestigates the perception of the otherness consciousness in the Old Testament. The first chapter reveals that Jehovah’s images in various historic periods mirror the Jewish ethnic characters and that as a representative of otherness, the God of Sanctity plays a guiding role in the formation of the Jewish character. Conversely, the next chapter explicates the Jewish ethnicity’s creation of otherness images such as other races and other gods for constructing the ideal mirror image of themselves and its expansion of the self by highlighting other’s opposition.In the further discussion, the paper studies the influence of the biographical features of the Old Testament on the narration of the New Testament, the hagiology and the ensuing biographical writings with emphasis laid on the evolution and writing strategies of the hagiology in the Middle Ages."

　　反对大众语文的人，对主张者得意地命令道：“拿出货色来看！”②一面也真有这样的老实人，毫不问他是诚意，还是寻开心，立刻拚命的来做标本。

　　由读书人来提倡大众语，当然比提倡白话困难。因为提倡白话时，好好坏坏，用的总算是白话，现在提倡大众语的文章却大抵不是大众语。但是，反对者是没有发命令的权利的。虽是一个残废人，倘在主张健康运动，他绝对没有错；如果提倡缠足，则即使是天足的壮健的女性，她还是在有意的或无意的害人。美国的水果大王，只为改良一种水果，尚且要费十来年的工夫，何况是问题大得多多的大众语。倘若就用他的矛去攻他的盾，那么，反对者该是赞成文言或白话的了，文言有几千年的历史，白话有近二十年的历史，他也拿出他的“货色”来给大家看看罢。

　　但是，我们也不妨自己来试验，在《动向》上，就已经有过三篇纯用土话的文章③，胡绳④先生看了之后，却以为还是非土话所写的句子来得清楚。其实，只要下一番工夫，是无论用什么土话写，都可以懂得的。据我个人的经验，我们那里的土话，和苏州很不同，但一部《海上花列传》⑤，却教我“足不出户”的懂了苏白。先是不懂，硬着头皮看下去，参照记事，比较对话，后来就都懂了。自然，很困难。这困难的根，我以为就在汉字。每一个方块汉字，是都有它的意义的，现在用它来照样的写土话，有些是仍用本义的，有些却不过借音，于是我们看下去的时候，就得分析它那几个是用义，那几个是借音，惯了不打紧，开手却非常吃力了。

　　例如胡绳先生所举的例子，说“回到窝里向罢”也许会当作回到什么狗“窝”里去，反不如说“回到家里去”的清楚⑥。那一句的病根就在汉字的“窝”字，实际上，恐怕是不该这么写法的。我们那里的乡下人，也叫“家里”作 Uwao - li，读书人去抄，也极容易写成“窝里”的，但我想，这 Uwao 其实是“屋下”两音的拼合，而又讹了一点，决不能用“窝”字随便来替代，如果只记下没有别的意义的音，就什么误解也不会有了。

　　大众语文的音数比文言和白话繁，如果还是用方块字来写，不但费脑力，也很费工夫，连纸墨都不经济。为了这方块的带病的遗产，我们的最大多数人，已经几千年做了文盲来殉难了，中国也弄到这模样，到别国已在人工造雨的时候，我们却还是拜蛇，迎神。如果大家还要活下去，我想：是只好请汉字来做我们的牺牲了。

　　现在只还有“书法拉丁化”的一条路。这和大众语文是分不开的。也还是从读书人首先试验起，先绍介过字母，拼法，然后写文章。开手是，像日本文那样，只留一点名词之类的汉字，而助词，感叹词，后来连形容词，动词也都用拉丁拼音写，那么，不但顺眼，对于了解也容易得远了。至于改作横行，那是当然的事。

　　这就是现在马上来实验，我以为也并不难。

　　不错，汉字是古代传下来的宝贝，但我们的祖先，比汉字还要古，所以我们更是古代传下来的宝贝。为汉字而牺牲我们，还是为我们而牺牲汉字呢？这是只要还没有丧心病狂的人，都能够马上回答的。`,

        "abstract": `鲁迅提倡汉语拉丁化，首先是出于对中国旧文化机制的腐蚀性强烈的拒斥，
        同时也是出于对于劳动者深深的同情。在《汉字和拉丁化》一文中，鲁迅说：
        “大众语文的音数比文言和白话繁，如果还是用方块字来写，不但费脑力，也很
        费工夫，连纸墨都不经济。为了这方块的带病的遗产，我们的最大多数人，已经
        几千年做了文盲来殉难了，中国也弄到这模样，到别国已在人工造雨的时候，我
        们却还是拜蛇，迎神。如果大家还要活下去，我想：是只好请汉字来作我们的牺
        牲品了。”进而得出结论：“现在只还有‘书法拉丁化’的一条路。这和大众语
        文是分不开的。也还是从读书人首先试验起，先绍介过字母，拼法，然后写文章。
        开手是，象日本文那样，只留一点名词之类的汉字，而助词，感叹词，后来连形
        容词，动词也都用拉丁拼音写，那么，不但顺眼，对于改作横行，那是当然的
        事。”（《鲁迅全集》第５卷第５５６页至第５５７页）这里，鲁迅提出了一个
        要汉字还是要我们的问题——“为汉字而牺牲我们，还是为我们而牺牲汉字呢？”
        （同前，第５５７页）这里的立论不是没有问题，但更值得我们分析的是鲁迅态
        度之恳切、用心之良苦。多年之后，杨振宁撰文指出：“中国近代科技落后，除
        了一些公认的原因......还有一些怪论如汉民族‘种族退化论’、‘取消汉字汉
        语论’，则反应了在西方科技面前的自卑心里。”（《中国科技报》１９９７年
        ７月１日）我们结合这句话掉头再看鲁迅将“汉字——拉丁化”与“拜蛇，迎神
        ——人工降雨”相比论的做法，在反思进化论、民族虚无主义的是非功过，检讨
        ２０世纪留给我们的种种无奈与不平的同时，我们更应当做的，或许正是去仔细
        体味一下鲁迅，体味一下身为落后民族一员，背负了数千年文明沧桑，肩住了黑
        暗的闸门的鲁迅，说出来“是只好请汉字来做我们的牺牲品了”这句话的时候的
        悲壮心情。`,

            "p1": "In antiquity, “son of god”—meaning a ruler designated by the gods to carry out their will—was a title used by the Roman emperor Augustus and his successors as a way to reinforce their divinely appointed status. But this title was also used by early Christians to speak about Jesus, borrowing the idiom from Israelite and early Jewish discourses on monarchy. This interdisciplinary volume explores what it means to be God's son(s) in ancient Jewish and early Christian literature. Through close readings of relevant texts from multiple ancient corpora, including the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Greco-Roman texts and inscriptions, early Christian and Islamic texts, and apocalyptic literature, the chapters in this volume engage a range of issues including messianism, deification, eschatological figures, Jesus, interreligious polemics, and the Roman and Jewish backgrounds of early Christianity and the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The essays in this collection demonstrate that divine sonship is an ideal prism through which to better understand the deep interrelationship of ancient religions and their politics of kingship and divinity. In addition to the editors, the contributors to this volume include Richard Bauckham, Max Botner, George J. Brooke, Jan Joosten, Menahem Kister, Reinhard Kratz, Mateusz Kusio, Michael A. Lyons, Matthew V. Novenson, Michael Peppard, Sarah Whittle, and N. T. Wright.",

            "p9": "The claim of Jesus to be the son of God, asserted by the NT, is one of the most difficult aspects of Christian religion. It not only makes Christian's relationshp to its mother religion, Judaism, difficult but also presents significant problems for Christianity in the modern world. The description of a person or a heavenly being as 'Son of God' is not self-evident, particulary under the conditions of the Enlightenment and according to our categories of understanding. God and heavenly beings belong to a reality that defies the worldview of the modern era. This applies even more to the genealogical relationship that is expressed by the term 'son'.  To put it quite simply: since, with our usual (modern) categories of understanding, we cannot say who or what God is, there is no way we can know who or what a 'son of God' is.",

            "p10": "Psa2:7 (my son, whome I have gegotten today.) As in Egypt, the act of enthronement signifies the procreation of the king as a god. We dealing here with a metaphorical understanding of the title of 'son of God'. The image depicts the generic concept in concrete terms and expresses the divine quality through the idea of biological descent. This figurative use of language is also the basis of the promise to David in 2Sa 7:14 'I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.' (2Sa7:14 NIV) Furthermore, this usage is transferred to the people of Israel, to the exiles, and finally to the poius, who are called 'sons of God'. Addresing God as 'father' in prayers also makes uses of figurative speech.[WD:this is to prove that Jesus preexist over the world]",

            "p10a": "The title 'son of God' thus refers to the divine attribute of a heavenly or earthly being, bit it as a generic term for 'divine' or as a mythical and figurative way of speaking about the procreation and birth of a god. This is also the case in the few places in the Hebrew Bible that mention 'sons of God' Of all the locations in which we encounter the plural 'sons', only (Dan3:25) do we also find the sigular 'son of God'. in Aramaic. The usage continues in parabiblical writings and in the Dead Dea Scrolls. ",

            "p17": "Just as 'the son of man' (Dan7:18,7:27) represents the 'holy ones of the Most Hight', the people of the holy ones of the the most Hight, so could the 'son of God in 4Q246 represent the 'people of God in ii,4",
