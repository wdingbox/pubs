annote              ={All of us are people of a culture, and we carry our cultural heritage and practices, including our practice of faith, with us into every situation of life.

The Bible gives principles for living that transcend culture,

The basic argument in this book is that our culture serves us well when it is the only culture in focus. In fact, it is a palace when there are no other contesting voices around us, when we can live fairly comfortable, ordered lives in the context of our own cultural system. However, when we are pushed into relationships that are outside the boundaries of our culture, that culture becomes a prison to us.


that all of us are prisoners to our culture.(p20)

we become so enamored of it that we cannot imagine any other way (p20)

As a consequence, we are blind to cultural differences and do not even think to question why people act or think differently than we do. (p20)

Its not about the knowlege its about the holy spirit. (weid)

We were raised to be proud of our culture, (p23)

My cultural identity had changed because (p24)
cultural id cann't be changed. 

They may also verbalize them in ritual and stories about the group's history. (p39)},

The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},
