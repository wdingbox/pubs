			About The Man</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			The man are the central concepts and the key words of all vocabulary for any human languages. All vocabularies were created by man, used by man, and interpreted by and for man. The man are alway among the top most frequently used words in human historical books. It is the character and concept of man in a system that differentiated itself from human languages to all kinds of computer and any other lanuages languages no matter how similar they are in grammars.</p>
		<p>
			Different religions view the man differently. In TBI, to study how the picture of a man were abstracted from the features of real man can help us to understand the very original ideas and purpose of the characters inventors, as well as their hearts, feelings, passions, emotions, associated with their religious believes, ideology of universe, and phylosophy etc. To fully understand the meaning of man in TBI was the whole thing of the writing system.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			This paper will listed all characters for man and through comparison and analysis we found that the man, the son, the king, the servants,etc. all have have common features. What they descripting indeed were special and all for the same one person.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Types of Man in TBI</strong></p>
		<p>
			Among all characters in TBI, there are only five foundmental root character that were used to denote the five different human being. From OOA view points, all other types of peoples of charcters are the variantion or derived from them. For all variations of different characters, see notes[TableOfManInTBI] [TableOfPronounsInTBI].</p>
		<p> See <a href="./4.__03_1001_Types_of_Man.htm">(*)</a>. </p>
		<p>
			The picture of the front view of the standup man was used to represent the king great; the sideview of humble standup worshiper was used to denote the man; the sideview of the man on the knees were used to denote worship but not used for today in standalone character.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
            See <a href="./4.__03_1001_Types_of_Pronoun.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. The Man vs Animals in TBI.</strong></p>
		<p>
			We listed all characters represent different animals in the table. </p>
		See <a href="./4.__03_1001_Side_View_Of_Animal.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Different from the character of man that had strong religious features in the visual picture, all characters of animals have the biological outlook properties to denote different animals. The different sideview of the same kind of animal has no different in meaning. For example, the turtle of side and top views.</p>
		<p>
			It is through this difference type of features used in characters design that demonstrated how man differentiated from the animals -- the human being are the heavenly religious animal. It could well explain why the corpse or dead person came from the man with curved back and looking like a snake -- when a person lost its humble worship style, he became a dead man.</p>
		<p>
			Also it showed us that the religions are the driven force to generate the civilization. The Chinese writing system and religion are not dividable from the very beginning This could well explain why the writing system was only found in bones and bronzes nowhere else -- which kept it sacred.</p>
		<p>
			Although there still exist difficulties to distinguish between similar animals, like ox vs pig, it was really not very important. Since all animals in their eyes were merely the sacrifices in the rituals. This could successfully explain why almost all animals was turn 90 degree toward to up heaven rather than the normal status on the horizontal ground.</p>
		<p>
			If we listed all characters used to represent the body parts of human being, we can find that none of them has biological features from the man. Instead most of them looks the body part of animals. However, the characters of parts of body are commonly used to depict the detailed action, intention, or to express an idea or feeling&nbsp;for human being, seldomly used for animals. This fact demonstrated that the TBI originators considered the parts of human body same as the the body of animals. There is no differences for the body parts between human and animals in flesh.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__03_1001_Parts_Of_Body.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. About the Face of Man</strong></p>
		<p>
			The front of the human head is called the face. The human face is the central organ of human sense. The human facial image not only could identify the individual entity, but also contain the rich information about his age, genda, emotion, social status, personal experiences, spiritual status, and believes etc. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			With the drawing techniques used pictograms in TBI, it is not hard to abstract different human faces into characters to express different emotions, atitude, or individual of king etc. However, we only found the face as pictograms on goat, ox and snake. The most frequently and clearly face&nbsp;picogram is the face of a goat or&nbsp;a lamb. Both goat and ox face image are in top 400 most frequently used words in TBI. The face for snake is arguable and its frequency is as low as 1.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__03_1001_Face_Of_Man.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			In TBI, the character of face is presented by a single eye in the worship house -- that is quite different in image to human face. This phenonmenon indicated that all types of persons shown as the characters in TBI were not the regular human being we thought today. They all related to goat, ox or snakes animals with religious purpose.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. About Hands and Feet of Man</strong></p>
		<p>
			Among all characters for body parts, the hand and foot are very special -- they exist in both&nbsp;pictorgram and logograms.&nbsp;Although in many cases, we&nbsp;found that pictogram hand or foot&nbsp;can be interchangable to logograms of hand and foot. But there&nbsp;exist differneces between&nbsp;logograms and pictograms in hand and foot.&nbsp;No matter the words belongs to pictograms or logograms, none of them looks like part of human body.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__03_1001_Hand_and_Foot.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The logogram hand has highest RF (about 744) among all roots characters. Since it inherited from the cross, so it contains the meaning for the nailed hand. The pair of hand in TBI had very special power -- anything that being hold the pair of hands usually means the sacred object. (see table)</p>

			<strong>6. The Story about the Man</strong></p>
		<p>
			In the process to explore the unknown mysterious inscriptions lost for more than three thousands years, the most important thing we need to know is about their religious believes. Since everthing they left was the results of what they believed. One of the best ways to understand what the people thought is to observe how did they lived, their personal traits and social activities etc.</p>
		<p>
			There are more than one thousand of compound characters containing various types of man (including woman) that takes about a quater of all. From the visual thinking aspect, each of these characters is a snapshot about the story of their life. The amount of pictures we had is rich enough in both quantities and quality to understand who they are and what they want.</p>
		<p>
			For similicity in discussion, we arrange these characters according to following subjects similar to the ways of photo albums:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Social life<br />
				two, three peoples [PeoplesRelationship]<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Personal life<br />
				Personalities [PeoplesPersonalities]<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Activities<br />
				of people we need to understand their personalities, behavors and their relationships. There are many different characters to denote different people. But only five of them have the most hight RF values. The most significant relashitonship among them are the son and woman, Hao (good). (see table)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<strong>7. Analysis</strong></p>
		<p>
			From above discussion, we can find that the man has following features:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				All types of men are sacred:<br />
				All men were equally highly raised by both hands (see&nbsp;the table[RaisedByHands])<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				No social or family hierachy relationship between men.<br />
				We could not find any hierachy relationship between the father and son, king and slave etc in TBI.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Woman and son have most frequently relationship:<br />
				We also find that woman and son has special high usage rate among all paired comparison[PeoplesRelationship].<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Animal Body Parts for Men:<br />
				We find that all person are abstract, no specific person. not image icon or ideal&nbsp; no face image for human but face for goat.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				No Idol Face:<br />
				No any&nbsp;human face was found as an idol&nbsp;in TBI. It is also not &#39;myself&#39; centered.&nbsp;<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Thorugh these pictures, we can conclude that all different styles of the man were actually the same one person.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			From above analysis, we can find that four different types of men, have the personalities in consistency -- &nbsp;they are humble, devoted, rightous, weak, suppressed, persecuted, &nbsp;etc. All of these characters were the different angles for one person -- the prayer, the king, the servant, the son of man -- that were discribed in Gospel. &nbsp;</p>
