			Origin of TBI</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Background</strong></p>
		<p>
			Regarding the origin of Chinese characters, currently there are two types of models that we can summarize:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Creation Model<br />
				Based on the legends or some historical records, many scholars proposed that the Chinese characters were created by ancient sages, like Yu, CiangJie[Ciangjie]. However, such kind of model lacks scientific evidences and could not be verified.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Evolution Model<br />
				This Evolution Model believes that Chinese characters were gradually developed from a low level of some painting/drawing/symbols to high-level intelligent writing system thru natural selection. Such model can well explain how some of the pictograms could assembly to the objects we observed, but it also has many other issues that we could not explain; its archeological evidences are also flimsy.<br />
				<br />
				We could apply the Creation Model into Egypt hieroglyphics or Maya iconic writing development systems study. Since we have found a large amount of painting/drawing that associated with the characters in their writing system, although it was still arguable in scholars.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Revelation Model</strong></p>
		<p>
			There are three significant archeological facts about TBI:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				A remarkably large number of TBI were discovered extensively on a small areas at Anyang. No significant related other bones inscriptions could be found around it or any other remote places. The character density at Anyang is extremely higher than anywhere else.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The highly intelligent mature TBI suddenly appeared in history at the beginning of Shang Dynasty. No significant other related TBI could be found before or after this period. There is no significant language evolution evidence before and during the several hundreds of Shang Dynasty. The writing system formation speed is like explosion.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The turtle bones were used as writing media only during the TBI times. Before and after that, we could hardly find turtle bones as writing medias in history.&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			These three archeological features are significantly different from any other archeological discoveries in China. The single spot in location, the sharp pulse in time, the perfect in complicated writing system, the quantity of the characters, the object-oriented design methods, full coverage in human thoughts, its foundation roles in whole Chinese cultures, as well as its connections to the biblical accounts, and so on, all of these factors drove us to suggest the Revelation Model -- the Chinese writing system was created at one time at Yingxu by sages or prophecies through the heavenly revelation that were similar to those described in the biblical accounts.</p>
		<p>
			From the viewpoint of science, through the visible evidences in archeology and history, the Revelation Model means the origin of Chinese writing system was the results of the subconscious inspiration through many medium mainly including the turtle under the earth, the constellation from heaven, and the remote prophecy culture from foreign like Egypt, the biblical accounts or other oral legends resources. The original intention was to antedate the expected story about the cross -- the hope and the way that could help to escape the unresistant falling of man.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Turtle and TBI</strong><br />
				<br />
				Along with the sudden emerge of the TBI was there the small animal of the turtle. The archeological evidences show that TBI first appeared on turtle bones,&nbsp; then fully on bronzes, then moved onto bamboos, stones, papers, internet, etc. and became today&#39;s simplified or traditional forms of Chinese characters. The turtle bones, however, seldomly found before or soon after TBI times. What was remained in the long history were the giant stone turtles. So what is the relationship between the turtle and Chinese language? What kind of the role the turtle ever played in TBI?<br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;As compared with many other animals, like lion or tiger, turtle was small, ugly, dirty and disgusting. However, if we look into its shell, we can find that the turtle shell has two unique features that any other bones in the world does not have. The first, its plastron possess clear visible schism pattern which can perfectly match oracle bones inscription&#39;s character pattern. If we compare such schism pattern with OBI, we can find that many fundamental root characters, like the cross, sheep, son, etc. can perfect match to the plastron schism pattern. This schism pattern also contains the object-oriented concepts. This unique feature related to writing suggested that the turtle could be one of the medias to contribute to the invention of Chinese writing system. See table <a href="./5.___07__1100___Turtle_schism_and_character.htm">Turtle Plastron Schism and Chinese Characters</a>.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				Not only did the turtle bones initiate the TBI, but also it created the first totem at the same time in China history. The shell, both plastron and carapace, had naturally inscribed various fearful mysterious, colorful drawing pattern. If we compare such ornament with the totem on bronzes and many other artistic works, we can found that they assembly to each others. See table <a href="./5.___07__1100___Turtle_and_Totem.htm">Turtle and Totem</a>.<br />
				<br />
				The totem was the symbol of divine in China. Similarly, we can find that Chinese characters were treated as same divine as totem at Shang times. This could explain the facts that earliest Chinese writing scriptures only appeared on turtle bones, as well as on bronzes, both of them were the center of sacred rituals.<br />
				<br />
				The TBI was initially used in religious rituals that pointed to the heaven -- that demonstrated some initial implied purpose of its creation, as well as its driven force of origin -- at one hand the civilization was developed in a high level at the edge of explosion; on the other hand, at the same time, the society was full of serious crisis, the uncertainty, upset, desperation and threatening at the edge of broken. The characters on bronzes along with TBI demonstrated its divinity features of the all-mighty, judgment, righteousness, sovereign from the God. This could explain why we have found the plant leaves[WangShuzhi], but we could not find bamboo inscriptions, silk scriptures, stone inscriptions, or any other types of&nbsp; medias as books with such matured and advanced writing system at or before TBI times. The character Shu in TBI was not the regular book we thought for today, but the book about the story of good news that they expected for their future.<br />
				<br />
				Because of the roles turtle ever played for Chinese culture, China is the only country in the world to treat turtle as mysterious and sometimes idolatry or superstitious symbolic[LijiLiYun] over all lands and in all dynasties.[FanFangfang] The sculpture of turtles can still be found in many relics site today. For example, the stone turtle carrying a stone stele on its back was very common in many temples in China today; the others are like, the stone turtle in temple of heaven built during 1406 to 1420 in Beijing, the turtle seals found in WaWangDui tomb (West Han 206-BC) and so on.  <a href="./5.___07__1100___Turtle_in_China.htm">(see table:Turtles in China)</a><br />
				<br />
				Today people consider words of turtle as shameful and insulting languages in China. They totally forgot its fundamental roles ever played as the cradle of Chinese writing system as well as the origin of totem in art in Chinese culture. It should be the turtle, not dragon, considered as Chinese national emblem.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Constellation and TBI</strong><br />
				<br />
				The archeological evidences show that the TBI, all kinds of bronzes, temples, or even the tombs were all religious undividable. No personal statues or any idols were ever found at Yingxu. The central of their religion was nothing but the Heaven. So the origin of Chinese writing system, religion and the Heaven are bonded together.<br />
				<br />
				The most obvious and easiest recognizable grammars in TBI was about the description of the advanced accurate calendar system -- the periodical GanZhi serials. As we know that calendar system and astronomy are undividable. This further led us to discover the close relationship between the characters and the constellation -- many fundamental character shapes can match the stars pattern on the sky. Such connections suggested that earliest characters were simplified directly from complicated real object image drawing/painting through visual thinking and comparison of constellation -- a character can be instantly directly created with similarity of real of object without the process of painting/drawing with art and techniques. Some of the characters was likely to be picked up from the sky directly, like the &#39;Northern Cross&#39; for today. No evolution process was needed at all.<br />
				<br />
				In order to show how easily the TBI could be identified or created from sky, we choose the modern OSI and some hundreds of years old chinese constellations charts as examples. We can find that Orion is similar to &#39;cross&#39;, Gemini Twin to Chong, Draco and Ursa Minor to animal body, Cygnus to Lai (come), dipper to Ji, etc. See table <a href="./5.___07__1100___Constellation_and_Character.htm">Constellations and Characters</a>.&nbsp; On the other hands, the small circles, dot lines and arrows among OBI reflected the features of constellation charts.<br />
				<br />
				However, constellation is the visual thinking pictures of stars. So different believes will produce different constellation charts. One of the biggest challenges for this theory is that we could not find any original constellation chart at Anyang site. But the matured and advanced calendar showed that they knew astronomy very well.<br />
				<br />
				Inspired from constellation, and used back for the calendar system, it was inside of the same internal process of writing system invention process. Heaven (天) and god (神) are exchangeable in meaning and usage in Chinese literature and philosophy concepts. The term astronomy itself in Chinese (天文TianWen) means &#39;heaven&#39; and &#39;language&#39; (天Tian: heaven, 文Wen: language, writing, scripts, character, culture etc.) -- the heaven and Chinese writing system are undividable.[HuangDiNeiJin]<br />
				<br />
				Such theory could explain why the most animal pictograms, like dog, horse, pig, etc., in TBI that was written in a vertical way headed to upside rather than in a horizontal way. It was implying that they came from heaven. There exist a large amount of rotated symmetric characters, like Hua, etc. since it is the polar star centered constellation movement. Recently, some scholars began to explore this area about Chinese ancient astronomy. [FengShi] It has shown us that ancient sages know more than what we do about the astronomy for today.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>Hieroglyphics and TBI</strong><br />
				<br />
				Since the discovery of the silk road, more and more evidences have been found to indicate that the message exchange between east and west already existed at Shang dynasty.[silkroad]&nbsp; According to the archeological report in Anyang in 2000, among the large amount of buried skulls in royal tombs, some of them belong to Europe Caucasians race[AnyangLiJi].<br />
				<br />
				In our obi study, we also found that there exists a large amount of similarities between hieroglyphics and Chinese characters, not only on the symbols, patterns of combination words, but also on the worship, believes, as well as its kernel symbol of &#39;cross&#39; which can be deducted as subconscious antedating as Chinese characters. See table <a href="./5.___07__1100___Hieroglyphics_and_TBI.htm">Comparison Between TBI and Hieroglyphics</a>. Such similarities could be considered as another evidence of culture exchanges between west and east at ancient times.<br />
				<br />
				On the other hand, the similarities existed between Chinese and hieroglyphics suggest that Chinese characters invention were more or less influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphics and its culture. This could explain why there were no painting/drawing as early stage of writing existed. Since the early practice developing stages were already finished during hieroglyphics times for the inventors.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In summary, using the revelation model to create a root character, it needs to meet at least three conditions at the same time:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				assembly to real object in the image on earth.</li>
			<li>
				match constellation in shape in heaven.</li>
			<li>
				predict the upcoming events in some ways related to the story about the &#39;cross&#39; around at 1 AD.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			These conditions defined the properties of characters with uniqueness, divinity and unchangeable, where the powerful life of character it came from, and how they could distinguish themselves to other fake characters, like the simulated oracle characters created for 2008 Beijing Olympic Games <a href="./5.___01_Tbl-TBI_BeijingOlympic2008.htm">(BeijingOlimpic)</a>. The essential differences between OBI and Hieroglyphics came from the constellation match.</p>
		<p>
			Chinese characters are the only pictograms languages in the world that is still in use for today. Since created, within more than three thousands years, Chinese characters experienced many different dynasties, split, wars, expansion, foreign invasion and culture genocide, as well as all kinds of foreign religious impacts like Buddha or materialism etc; Chinese characters itself also experienced all kinds of operations, like the so-called unification, simplification and obsoleting and so on; the characters we used for today, the simplified or traditional, already look quite different from its original one in shape; Although we can still recognize its root of characters, along with the changes of shapes, Chinese people gradually lost many original meaning of each character; they lost the original purpose of usage of characters; they forgot ancestors who invented the characters; they forgot where the characters came from, how the characters were invented, when they were invented; they lost many technology associated with the characters like astronomy, calendars, metallics, medicines etc; they lost the original virtues, spirits as well as ancestor&#39;s believes. From this point, through thousands of years, we can see that Chinese characters were not evolved at all but rather had been undergoing a devolution process in long history.</p>
		<p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>3. Conclusions</strong><br />
			<br />
			Among three models (creation, evolution and revelation), the revelation model can best scientifically expose the essence of origin of Chinese characters. It does not contradict to the creation model but can provide abundant archeological evidences and logical reasoning that creation model could not do. The evolution model seems most problematic to the origin of Chinese characters.</p>
