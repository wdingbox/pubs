conclusion:
Bible is the only book in the world that can naturally decode the meaning of tbi. 

As matter of fact, 4 areas can be related to Bible account.
oral legend, customer habit, rituals and culture. 


People can make some kinds of relationship among anything in the world directly or inderectly.
Connections between tbi and bible seems to be redicuous for many people.
But this is the fact: Christians or those who believe trinity are easier to be able to understand and learn tbi 
than any other believers including scientists, materialms. 

This connection relationship can only be found by man, that the computer AI can not reach at all.
