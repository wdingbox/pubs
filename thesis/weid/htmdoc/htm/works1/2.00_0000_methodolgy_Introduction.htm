			The TBI study are extremely complicated not only because its quantities of about five thousands individual characters with large amount of variants for each individual, but also the many-to-many relationships with countless crisscross&nbsp;among those. None of a single method we could find is sufficient enough to grasp these complexities. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			As a scientific research, this paper proposed a set of fundamental methods or theories as our doctrines or axioms for our logical reasoning on TBI studies. People may disagree with some or all of methodologies used in this paper. For example, the devolution theory seems contradict to the Darwin&#39;s evolution theory. However, with these theory, they make our discussion very simple. The paper simply adopt these methodoligies with brief discriptions. Further research and discussion will be out of our scope.&nbsp;</p>
