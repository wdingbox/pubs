			&nbsp;Human Devolution (biology)<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			The term Devolution appeared in biology as early as in the 19th Century,&nbsp; an opposite theory against Darwin&#39;s envolution, neglected by main stream,&nbsp; is still valuable for today:</p>

			<li>
				The species diversity is the result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment, rather than randomly natural selections.&nbsp; (Lamarckism and orthogenesis)</li>
			<li>
				Darwin soothed readers that evolution was progressive, and directed towards human perfectibility. The next generation of biologists were less confident or consoling. Using Darwin&#39;s theory, and many rival biological accounts of development then in circulation, scientists suspected that it was just as possible to devolve, to slip back down the evolutionary scale to prior states of development.(10)(Luckhurst, 2005)</li>

		<p>
			As a&nbsp;mater of fact, both envolution and devolution believe that a species can change from one to another&nbsp;due to its accumulated mutation for what ever purpose through over certain mount of time period.&nbsp;Both conclusions are based upon the observation in our real world the existance of variation among same species and similarities among different species. They all ignored the differences between the inheritance and heredities in biology&nbsp;as we discussed in OOA method. Indeed the species, once discovered,&nbsp;never change.</p>
		<p>
			The devolution we&nbsp;discussed here is not about the changes of species in biology. It is about the quality of species specially for mankind that became poorer and poorer than its previous older one as time elapses.&nbsp;This thoughts are based upon the modern national statistics,&nbsp;historic observations and results of archiology.&nbsp;</p>

					Myopia Increasing in the U.S. Population<br />
					<br />
					A National Eye Institute (NEI) study found that the prevalence of myopia, or nearsightedness, increased 66 percent in the United States between 1971-1972 and 1999-2004.</p>
				<p>
					In 1971-1972, an estimated 25 percent of the United States population aged 12-54 was diagnosed with myopia. In this 2009 study, NEI researchers used similar methods to identify myopia cases using data from 1999-2004. They found that the prevalence estimate was 66 percent higher than in 1971-1972. Myopia prevalence rose more than 100 percent for blacks and 30-80 percent for whites.</p>
				<p>
					This study was done only for comparison with the 1971-1972 figures. The best estimate of U.S. myopia prevalence that NEI researchers have to date is 33.1 percent, which was determined in a 2008 study.</p>
				<p>
					This study was not designed to identify the causes of myopia. The NEI will continue to look for genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors associated with the condition.<br />

					Reporting in the journal Lancet, the authors note that up to 90% of young adults in major East Asian countries, including China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, are nearsighted. The overall rate of myopia in the U.K., by contrast, is about 20% to 30%.</p>

					Geneva, 3 April 2003 -Cancer rates could further increase by 50% to 15 million new cases in the year 2020, according to the World Cancer Report, the most comprehensive global examination of the disease to date. However, the report also provides clear evidence that healthy lifestyles and public health action by governments and health practitioners could stem this trend, and prevent as many as one third of cancers worldwide. <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr27/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr27/en/</a></p>

					mental disorders increasing over time<br />
					The impression that the prevalence of mental disorder has been increasing during the last decades is only partially justified. The considerable increase in the demand for psychiatric and psychotherapeutic help is influenced by quite a number of factors that vary in nature and direction. The most essential contribution was made by changes in the age composition of the population - and here primarily by the growing number of mentally ill elderly persons - and by the enormous increase in life expectancy. In milder psychiatric disorder the increase in the utilization of medical help is mainly due to new ways of treatment and to the great enlargement of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic services in most industrial countries, for which the zeitgeist of transition from a predominance of natural science to a more psychological understanding of life forms the background. Civilizational factors in a closer sense, like the raising of the achievement level for school beginners or alterations in the threshold of tolerance between mental illness needing medical intervention and mental suffering to be borne with submission to God&#39;s will, play an essential role particularly for the widening of the disease concept and thus for changes in the frequency of certain deficits of achievement and feeling, such as &#39;reading disorder&#39; or depressive states. The fact that the age-corrected risk of falling ill with schizophrenia has remained stable over many decades - wherever it could be investigated - does not point to a relation with variable environmental factors like industrialization, civilization or social order. In contrast with this disease in a closer sense, the rates of psychiatrically relevant forms of deviant behaviour - suicidal attempts, drug- and alcohol-related disorders - show rapidly changing upward and downward variations. Thus, they are more comparable to criminality rates that vary over time and culture. There is obviously a relation between changes in the frequency of deviant behaviour and changing patterns of values in society, such as the reduction of educational intensity and the commitment of adolescents to norms and convictions of their parents. This is why the most distinct changes in these rates occur at the age most accessible to contemporary or fashionable influences: in youth and younger adult age. Except for age-related changes, we do not seem to have become more ill than the generation of our parents, but more pessimistic.<br />

			. Being opposite to Darwin&#39;s evolution theory, the concept of devolution or degenerative evolution, or backward evolution theory was originally proposed by some scientists (like <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Lamarckism</span>, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">B&eacute;n&eacute;dict Morel,&nbsp; </span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Luckhurst, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Ray Lankester</span></span>, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Anton Dohrn,Dollo, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Hyatt,</span><br />
			Peter J. Bowler, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Carl H. Eigenmann, </span>William Morton Wheeler(19) and the Lamarckian Ernest MacBride etc</span> ) in the 19th century. They believe that a species can change into a more &quot;primitive&quot; simple form rather than advanced complexity.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			It is associated with the idea that evolution is supposed to make species more advanced,</p>
		<p>
			and that some modern species have lost functions or complexity and seem to be degenerate forms of their ancestors.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			This view is rejected by modern evolutionary theory, in which adaptation arises from natural selection of forms best suited to the environment, and so can lead to loss of features when these features are costly to maintain. Thus for cave dwelling animals the loss of eyes arises because it is an advantage, not degeneracy.(1)</p>
		<p>
			In pre-evolutionary ideas of essentialism following on from <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Plato&#39;s Theory of Forms, species were seen as pure unchanging types. </span></p>
		<p>
			Essentialism is rejected when genetic variation within kind is understood. The concept of created kinds can lead creationists to argue that genetic mutations are &quot;devolution&quot; away from the created type. Evolutionists prefer population genetics and what Ernst Mayr calls &quot;population thinking&quot; in defining species.(2)<br />
			<br />
			The idea of devolution can arise from thinking that &quot;evolution&quot; requires some sort of purposeful direction towards &quot;increasing complexity&quot;.</p>
		<p>
			Modern evolution theory accepts the possibility of decreasing complexity, as in vestigiality, in the course of evolutionary change,(3) but earlier views that species are subject to &quot;racial decay&quot;or &quot;drives to perfection&quot; or &quot;devolution&quot; have been rejected.(4) Early scientific theories of transmutation of species such as <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Lamarckism</span> and orthogenesis perceived species diversity as a result of a <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment</span>, but in the modern evolutionary synthesis evolution through natural selection comes about when random <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">heritable mutations </span>happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the environment they arise in, while the many disadvantageous mutations are lost.<br />

			Thought or thinking is the mental process in which beings form psychological associations and models of the world. Thinking is manipulating information, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reason and make decisions. A thought may be an idea, an image, a sound or even an emotional feeling that arises from the brain.<br />

			--------------------<br />
			<br />
			The concept of devolution or degenerative evolution was used by scientists in the 19th century, at this time it was believed by most biologists that evolution had some kind of direction.<br />
			<br />
			In 1857 the physician <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">B&eacute;n&eacute;dict Morel</span> influenced by Lamarckism claimed that environmental factors such as taking drugs or alcohol would produce degeneration in the offspring of those individuals, and would revert those offspring to a primitive state.(8) Morel a devout Catholic had believed that mankind had started in perfection, contrasting modern humanity to the past, Morel claimed there had been &quot;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Morbid </span>deviation from an original type&quot;.(9) The theory of devolution, was later advocated by some biologists.<br />
			<br />
			According to (<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Luckhurst</span>, 2005):<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darwin soothed readers that evolution was progressive, and directed towards human perfectibility. The next generation of biologists were less confident or consoling. Using Darwin&#39;s theory, and many rival biological accounts of development then in circulation, scientists suspected that it was just as possible to devolve, to slip back down the evolutionary scale to prior states of development.(10)<br />
			<br />
			One of the first biologists to suggest devolution was <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Ray Lankester</span>, he explored the possibility that evolution by natural selection may in some cases lead to devolution, an example he studied was the regressions in the life cycle of sea squirts. Lankester discussed the idea of devolution in his book Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism (1880). H<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">e was a critic of progressive evolution</span>, pointing out that higher forms existed in the past which have since degenerated into simpler forms.<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"> Lankester argued that &quot;if it was possible to evolve, it was also possible to devolve</span>, and that complex organisms could devolve into simpler forms or animals&quot;.(11)(12)<br />
			<br />
			<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Anton Dohrn</span> also developed a theory of degenerative evolution based on his studies of vertebrates. According to Dohrn many chordates are degenerated because of their environmental conditions. Dohrn claimed cyclostomes such as lampreys are degenerate fish as there is no evidence their jawless state is an ancestral feature but is the product of environmental adaptation due to parasitism. According to Dohrn if cyclotomes would devolve further then they would resemble something like an Amphioxus.(13)<br />
			<br />
			Peter J. Bowler has written that devolution was taken seriously by proponents of orthogenesis and others in the late 19th century who at this period of time firmly believed that there was a direction in evolution. Orthogenesis was the belief that evolution travels in internally directed trends and levels. The paleontologist Alpheus Hyatt discussed the concept of devolution in his work, Hyatt used the concept of racial senility as the mechanism of devolution. Bowler defines racial senility as &quot;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">an evolutionary retreat back to a state resembling that from which it began.&quot;</span>(14)<br />
			<br />
			<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Hyatt </span>who studied the fossils of invertebrates believed that up to a point ammonoids developed by regular stages up until a specific level but would later due to unfavourable conditions descend back to a previous level, this according to Hyatt was a form of lamarckism as the degeneration was a direct response to external factors. To Hyatt after the level of degeneration the species would then become extinct, according to Hyatt there was a &quot;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">phase of youth, a phase of maturity, a phase of senility or degeneration foreshadowing the extinction of a type</span>&quot;.(15)(16) To Hyatt the devolution was predetermined by internal factors which organisms can neither control or reverse. This idea of all evolutionary branches eventually running out of energy and degenerating into e<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">xtinction was a pessimistic view of evolution </span>and was unpopular amongst many scientists of the time.(17)<br />
			<br />
			<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Carl H. Eigenmann</span> an ichthyologist wrote Cave vertebrates of America: a study in degenerative evolution (1909) in which he concluded that cave evolution was essentially degenerative.(18) The entomologist William Morton Wheeler(19) and the Lamarckian Ernest MacBride (1866-1940) also advocated degenerative evolution. According to Macbride invertebrates were actually degenerate vertebrates, his argument was based on the idea that &quot;crawling on the seabed was inherently less stimulating than swimming in open waters.&quot;(20)<br />
			Dollo&#39;s law[edit]<br />
			Main article: Dollo&#39;s law<br />
			<br />
			<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Complex organs evolve in a lineage over many generations, and once lost they are unlikely to re-evolve</span>. This observation is sometimes generalized to a hypothesis known as Dollo&#39;s law, which states that <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">evolution is not reversible</span>. This does not mean that similar engineering solutions cannot be found by natural selection. For instance the tail of the cetacea&mdash;whales, dolphins and porpoises which are evolved from formerly land-dwelling mammals&mdash;is an adaptation of the spinal column for propulsion in water. Unlike the tail of the mammal&#39;s marine ancestor, the Sarcopterygii, and the other teleosts, which move from side to side, the cetacean&#39;s tail moves up and down as it flexes its mammalian spine, but the function of the tail in providing propulsion is remarkably similar.<br />
			Degeneration theory[edit]<br />
			Johan Friedrich Blumenbach 1752 - 1840<br />
			<br />
			Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and other monogenists such as Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon were believers in the &quot;Degeneration theory&quot; of racial origins the theory claims that races can degenerate into &quot;primitive&quot; forms. Blumenbach claimed that Adam and Eve were white and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors such as the sun and poor diet. Buffon believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.(21)<br />
			<br />
			Blumenbach claimed Negroid pigmentation arose because of the result of the heat of the tropical sun. The cold wind caused the tawny colour of the Eskimos and the Chinese were fair skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns protected from environmental factors.(22)<br />
			<br />
			According to Blumenbach there are five races all belonging to a single species: Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, American and Malay. Blumenbach however stated:<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have allotted the first place to the Caucasian because this stock displays the most beautiful race of men.(23)<br />
			<br />
			According to Blumenbach the other races are supposed to have degenerated from the Caucasian ideal stock. Blumenbach denied that his &quot;Degeneration theory&quot; was racist, he also wrote three essays claiming non-white peoples are capable of excelling in arts and sciences in reaction against racialists of his time who believed they couldn&#39;t.(23)<br />
			Streamlining evolution[edit]<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Devolution&quot;, the verb &quot;devolve&quot; and the past participle &quot;devolved&quot; are all common terms in science fiction for changes over time in populations of living things that make them less complex and remove some of their former adaptations. The terminology used herein is nontechnical, but the phenomenon is a real but counter-intuitive one, more accurately known as streamlining evolution[citation needed]. Since the development and maintenance of a feature such as an organ or a metabolite has an opportunity cost, changes in the environment that reduce the utility of an adaptation may mean that a higher evolutionary fitness is achieved by no longer using the adaptation, thus better using resources. This requires a mutation that inactivates one or more genes, perhaps by a change to DNA methylation or a methionine codon. Streamlining evolution allows evolution to remove features no longer of much/any use, like scaffolding on a completed bridge.<br />
			<br />
			However, &quot;devolution&quot; in practice typically refers to changes that occur from a problem no longer existing rather than superior solutions existing. For instance, of the several hundred known species of animal that live their entire lives in total darkness, most have non-functional eyes rather than no eyes. This is due, for instance, to deterioration of the optic nerve. It occurs because mutations that prevent eye formation have low probability. However, several eyeless animal species, such as the Kauai cave wolf spider, who live in total darkness, and whose ancestry mostly had eyes, do exist. Together with gene duplication, streamlining evolution makes evolution surprisingly able to produce radical changes, despite being limited to successive, slight modifications.<br />
			Which Numbers are the Most Common?<br />

			I&rsquo;ve often wondered which numbers are used most frequently. The low numbers (0, 1, 2) are probably the most common and the single-digit numbers are all among the most common, but how common are larger numbers and which larger numbers are the most common? Today I decided to find out.<br />
