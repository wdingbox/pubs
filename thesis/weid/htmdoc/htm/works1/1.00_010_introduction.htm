			Introduction</h1>

			<div>
				In 1899, the antique&nbsp;amateur and Qin government officer Wang Yirong 王懿荣 (1845-1900) accidentally found a few of the scripts on dragon bones in his Chinese herbs as ancient Chinese writing. Since then, more than 150,000 pieces[SamplingProcess_TotalBones] of different kinds of bones including turtle plastrons or carapaces, scapulae of oxen, etc. have been excavated at Anyang of China. There are totally about 600,000 sample[SamplingProcess_TotNumOfTBI] characters collected from all types of bones discovered. &nbsp;These characters are also called 甲骨文(JiaGuWen),&nbsp;Turtle Bone Inscriptions (TBI) or Oracle Bones Inscriptions. By around the middle of 20th century, Chinese scholars have distinguished about 5,000 different words[SamplingProcess_LiZhongKun] and recognized between 1,500 and 2,000 characters.&nbsp;</div>

				However, as China entered into 21st century, the research progress on the remained unknown 3,000 characters seems less significant in academic areas especially as compared with its earlier stage. The reasons for this could be many folds. First, we found that the coherent information between the TBI and the well-known existing traditional characters, classic books as well as other archeological materials, which we relied on to decode the unknown TBI for long time, seems to have been exhausted. Some scholars concluded that many unsolved TBI were mainly the meaningless or obsoleted symbols related to the name of the persons, places, or states that were only used at TBI times[GuoMoRuoSlaveTimes][WangGuoWeiBuCiDiMingKao].&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				Secondly, current TBI study approaches or methods are limited in traditional enclosed circumstances: it mainly depends on the research achievement on the Chinese classic documents and the archeological unearthed materials. Due to its complexity and magnitude, few western scholars could master the pith of ancient Chinese classic books. Besides, Chinese classic books&nbsp;itself exist many defects and need the supports for correction from many other areas including the TBI itself. Such kind of interdependent relationship makes the TBI study much more convoluted.&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				Thirdly, being influenced by the Darwin&#39;s evolution theory, many scholars are still waiting for the new desirable archeological materials from the ground, expecting more primitive writing data to fill in the gap in the gradual development process. Current discovered TBI were inscrutable for them without further evidences. In spite of the help of high technology, the industrialization&nbsp;made&nbsp;archeologically digable ground less and less, and so did the hope become less and less.</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				While Chinese archeologists were in the bottle neck of TBI study, some pioneers broke a new ground -- they pointed out that there exist the internal relationship between the Chinese characters and the biblical accounts. In 1950, Singapore-born pastor C. H. Kang published an unnoticeable book, Genesis and the Chinese (Hong Kong: Independent Printing)[CHKang]. In 1979, C. H. Kong and Ethel Nelson jointly published the book in English, The Discovery of Genesis: How the Truths of Genesis Were Found Hidden in the Chinese Language. Since then, more and &nbsp;more similar books began to appear. See&nbsp;<a href="./1.___RelatedBooksList.htm">(*)</a></div>
			<p>
				In those books, by analyzing the picture of characters, they illustrated that many Chinese characters carried the prominent stories of the Genesis. For example, the Chinese character creation(造) contains the information of &#39;dust&#39;, &#39;mouth&#39; and &#39;walk&#39;. The ship(船) contains a &#39;boat&#39; and eight mouths that can be refered to the number of Noah&#39;s family.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				Chinese phonetics was also used to analyze the link the Genesis and Chinese characters. For example, &#39;God&#39; in Mandarin as Shangti(上帝) is similar to Elohim, Yahweh or Shaddai in Hebrew in pronounciation.&nbsp;</p>
			<div>
				Probably, it was because the evidence was too weak, those books were not drawn into attention by archeologists or professionals. To face such situation, for the first time, based on traditional EZ method, this paper creatively introduced a set of distinctive approaches, including Biblical Evidence (BE), Object-Orient Analysis (OOA), &nbsp;Stimulus Diffusion theory, Devolution theory, Visual-thinking theory and statistic method etc. The final results showed that these new methods&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;helped us to open a new window through which we could perceive large amount of evidences that were ignored for long time before.&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				The research started with unearthed TBI data sampling process and overall general scriptures analysis in order to form a unified solid plateform to base upon. Under such framework and the guidance of new methodologies provided, there are two directions to explore. One is to focus on the writing structures and its inner meanings inside of TBI. Another will focus on its relational effects and roles in its culture and history outisde TBI. Although two directions seem opposite, as we dig into it deeper and deeper, under the base framework, we can see that they are perfectly consistently connected and supportive to each others.&nbsp;</div>

				To ease to read, examine or resuse, the whole paper is divided into ten sections. The methogologies are introduced in section III. All logical reasoning with lengthy words are deducted in section IV,V,VI. All evidences or discoveries including tables, pictures or snapshot reports are collected in Appendix in section X. The common readers, pastors or missionaries&nbsp;may be interested in materials in Appendix. The professional scholars or criticisers can emphasize on sections from &nbsp;III to VI. This paper may impact not only in the Chinese writing study areas, but also in archeology, history, philosophy, etc. The deocoded meaning of TBI could also contribute to the biblical exegesis study as a complementary evidence along with anciant Hebrew and Greeces. The extraodanary intelligent TBI writing system could possibly bring a revolution for the unified international writing system in the world.</div>
