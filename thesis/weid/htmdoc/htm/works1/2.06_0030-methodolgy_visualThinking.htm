			Visual Thinking Theory</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			The visual thinking theory became popular since perceptual psychologist Rudolf Arnheim published his book Art and Visual Perception in 1954. Rudolf believes that a mind must process two functions. It must gather information and it must process it[RudolfArnheim]. In theory, we can separate these two functions neatly. But in practice, they always work together at the same time. He conclude that the perceiving and thinking in cognition is undividable.</p>
		<p>
			The visual thinking theory can be tested through the psychologists E. G. Boring&#39;s famous picture &quot;My Wife and Mother-in-Law&quot;. What you see can be changed by switching what you think. People always say seeing is believing. As matter of fact, the opposite is correct. People usually see what they believe. Chinese old saying says: if you believe it then it exist. If you do not believe it, it does not exist.</p>

			<strong>2. Thoughts and TBI</strong></p>
		<p>
			In addition to multimedia areas, the visual thinking theory has to be applied into our TBI characters recongization/decoding through <a href="./2.04_004a-methodolgy_OOA.htm">(*) </a> method, since all Chinese characters came from the image of its objects. Chinese characters reading process foundimentally is a silent drawing visual thinking process rather than speaking reconginzation process.</p>
		<p>
			By applying the visual thinking theory into TBI study, we can conclude that, the same image with different thinking, believes, or religions can result in differently,&nbsp; and hence, unless we can fully understand the ancient people&#39;s believes at TBI times, otherwise, we could not clearly restore the explicit meanigful images carried in the abstracted characters of TBI.&nbsp; In another words, chinese characters and thoughts or religions are undividible. This tell us that, before we can figure out the meaning of TBI characters, we must know the religions and thoughts of the ancient people.</p>
		<p>
			Based on large amount of existing historic books, it is widely agree that the majority of ealiest traditional Chinese philosophy thoughts started during the Spring and Autumn and Warring State (700-400BC), which is also called as a period of Various Sons and Hundred Schools of Thought. The most popular thoughts include Confucianism, Mohism, Legalis and Daoism etc. During Han Dynasty (206 BC&ndash;220 AD) the Buddhaism was spead into china from India.</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, so far we know little about the thoughts or&nbsp;religions of far ancient china&nbsp;before 700BC, espcially the times of Shang dynasty 1500 BC. The lost thoughts in china history was the main reason we could not decode the characters of TBI.</p>
		<p>
			Scientifically speaking, with visual thinking&nbsp;theory, any kinds of religions or thoughts, no matter where and when they&nbsp;were originated,&nbsp;including Jews, Christians, Buddhaism, Indiasm&nbsp;or even Islam (after 650AD), could be used to perceive the chinese&nbsp;graphic characters&nbsp;of TBI to tell what they see. However, as we discussed later, specially&nbsp;on logographic,&nbsp;we found&nbsp;that only the biblical based christians theological&nbsp;thoughts can&nbsp;gave us the most rational meaning and satifying anwer about the origin of chinese characters in TBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The lost ancient objects that was used as image for Chinese characters, which could be due to the obsoletion, or habbit changes or techonlogy etc,&nbsp;like the temples, weapons, ritual devices or materials&nbsp;etc, was the another reason we could not decode the chinese characters in TBI. However, these only take very small part of whole characters, and manly limited on those of pictographic. Most of them are kept as same state as before until today, like sun, moon, mountain, water, animals, human&nbsp;etc.</p>
		<p>
			Hence, we can conclude that the information we lost today from TBI is mainly due to the lost of original believes during the transcendant. If we can find the beleives or thoughts&nbsp;at TBI times, we can restore the original purpose and meaning of TBI.</p>
		<p>

		<p>
			<strong>3. Engineering Drawing</strong></p>
		<p>
			Regardless the religions or thoughts affection on TBI chinese character reconization, if we techincally analyze the ways of how each root character of pictograms to represent the image of its object, we can surprisingly find that the method they used are extremely similar to the engineering drawing method that is widely used for today&#39;s mechanical and civil industry.</p>
		<p>
			A technical engineering drawing is a graphic representation of an object, or a part of it, and is the results of creative thought used for communications to aid in conveying a message, instructions, or an idea between different parties.&nbsp; From here, we can see that there is no significant differences in roles and forms between the engineering drawing and the chinese charaters of TBI in that they all can be considered as a graphical language that communicates ideas and all needed information from one mind to another correctly and accurately. Indeed, the graphical language is specially powerful than phonetic languages due to the fact that a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
		<p>
			Just like the purpose that learning of the engineering drawing methods can help people to draw and understand the meaning of blue prints, the same method can be applied into TBI study and help us to interpret the meaning of the long lost mysterious charaters of TBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
