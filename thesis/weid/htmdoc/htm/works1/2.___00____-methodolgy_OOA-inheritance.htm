			<strong>Inheritance </strong></p>
		<p>
			The inheritance is an important concept in OOA regarding about the relationship among classes, wherein a child class shares the attributes or behaviour of its parents or ancestors. Through inheritance relationship all classes can be virtually linked together to form a family with hierarchy tree. There are two types of inheritance: deriving and compositing. However their primary common purpose of inheritance is to get the reusability of attributes or behaviours among different classes.</p>
		<p>
			Seldomly is discussed about the relationship among objects in OOA. Since all objects can be freely cloned or self-reproduced if it is not a singleton, to discuss the relationship among objects are evitable. Druing the objects population process, the state of parents object can natually be passed into children objects. In order to differentiate the concept of inheritance, we call this phynomena as &#39;heredity&#39;.</p>
		<p>
			Although both inheritance and heredity are talking about something passing on between parents and children, with OOA introduced in discussion, they are essentially different. Inheritance refer to the attributes or behviours in parents classes that are permitted to reuse by children classes as if the children owned those attributes and behaviours. Heredity refer to the value of attributes or the state of behaviours when duplicated from parents to children. Inheritance passes along the access permission disscussed in encapsulation. Heredity passes on the values of attributes. Inheritance is taling about the copy right. Heredity is talking about the copy value. Inheritance belongs to metaphysics world. Heredity belongs to physics world. And it is more important that inheritance is a design time process, whereas heredity is run-time process. They are totally talking about two different concepts.</p>
		<p>
			In English dictionary, these two words show differences:</p>
		<p>
			inherit:</p>
		<p>
			1.Receive (money, property, or a title) as an heir at the death of the previous holder.<br />
			2.Derive (a quality, characteristic, or predisposition) genetically from one&#39;s parents or ancestors.</p>
		<p>
			heredity:</p>
		<p>
			1.The passing on of physical or mental characteristics genetically from one generation to another.<br />
			2.A person&#39;s ancestry.</p>
		<p>
			Literally, inheritance has preferences on legitimation, heredity has preferences on genes.</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, inheritance in object-oriented programming is a method that the properties or behavors can be passed down to its children classes.</p>
		<p>

			As an example of applying OOA in biology, how can we distinguish between inheritance and heredity? The similarities between two objects coming from different classes are inheritance. The similarities between two objects of same class are called heredity. When similarity happens among objects come from both same and different classes, then both inheritance and heredity coexist.</p>
		<p>
			Mendals laws, a theory of how hereditary characteristics are passed from parent organisms to their offspring, are totally based on the observation and experienemt on the selected traits on the same type of plant or insect. So his results are only reliable and valid for heredity study but useless for inheritance study.</p>
		<p>
			The hereditary modification is actually a changes of value of its attribute during the object self-reproduction process. Just as mendel&#39;s experiment showed us, the changed value could not permently held or unlimited accumulated. The result show that the values are predefined, enumerated or limited within a certain range. It came forth and back following certain propability rules. The Mendel&#39;s experiment also showed that we can easily make a significant changes of the values of an existing attributes within certain time by changes of enviroments or conditions, but we can not add, remove or change attributes to create a new species no matter how long the time spent, which can be proved thru archeological results.</p>
		<p>
			In the origin of species, written by Charles Robert Darwin, FRS (12 February 1809 &ndash; 19 April 1882), the inheritance and heredity are mixed used and considered as same concept. So the similarities between ape and human, the design time inheritance from two different species,&nbsp;were considered as time-space environment based hereditary modification. This misled us to conduct that the run-time chronical accumulated hereditary modifcation&nbsp;could cause to&nbsp;evolute all&nbsp;today&#39;s species from a common ancestors. There do exists a common root species as well as a hierachy tree family derived from that ancestor, however, this hiearchy tree is not formed chronically through run-time heredity, but formed thru design time inheritance, which can well match the many fossils what we found in archological study.</p>

			Applying OOA in our OBI study, we can find that Chinese writing system is&nbsp;a pure OO system like Java. It strongly demonstrates inheritance and heredity features both in writing and meaning:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				If we consider each OBI word as a class, all about 6k different words can be well fit into one inheritance hierachy tree with&nbsp; one root ancestor&nbsp;ONE that all other words derived from it.</li>
			<li>
				This hierachy tree is not spread out&nbsp;in average. There are about 500 words that have significant more children than all others and we call them the root words. 90% words words&nbsp;(also called leaf word) derived from 500 root words through compositing inheritance.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The same word with different forms of writing (Oracle, Bronze, Seal, Traditional and&nbsp;Simplified)&nbsp;&nbsp;can be considered as heredity from passing from original primitive form which is now recongized as TBI.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If we consider each chinese word have 5 different heredity modification&nbsp;form in history, with total 6k different inheritance words, the total forms will be 30k. Different from phonetic language&nbsp;that can be managed thru only dozens of alphabetic indexing digitally, chinese words became the most difficult to manage and learn&nbsp;especially in computer times. However, with OOA method, thrugh reverse engineering process,&nbsp;the estimated about&nbsp;30k different forms of symbols not only can be organically linked together into&nbsp;one 4-demesional hierachy tree meaningfully, but also tremediously reduce the redundancies due to the results of reusability caused by inheritance in design time, to very limited numbers of&nbsp;about 500 basic root symbols. OOA can make chinese characters the most easiest and most thoughtful lanugaes in the world.</p>
