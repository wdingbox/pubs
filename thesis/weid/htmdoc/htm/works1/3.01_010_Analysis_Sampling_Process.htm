			TBI Sampling Analysis Process</h2>
		<h3>
			Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			To effectively study the TBI without any prejudices, we have to start with the basic process of digging, collecting, inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data etc. in order to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				cover all the characters that we could find from unearthed materials without any missing.</li>
			<li>
				minimize the number of characters by consolidation of the redundancies, eleminate all forgeries and errors etc.</li>
			<li>
				discover useful information, expose the essential features, suggest a objective conclusion among the extracted samples of characters.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>
			Sampling Process</h3>
		<p>
			The sampling analysis process can be described as a <a href="./3.___020_Analysis-Flow-Chart.htm">five-stage sampling process flow chart</a>.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>On-site Collections</strong><br />
				<br />
				Since the TBI were discovered in 1899, more than 150,000 pieces of bones[TotalBones] (including turtle plastrons or carapaces,&nbsp; scapulae of oxen, and a few other types.) have been unearthed. Many broken bones have been reconstructed; A lot of sentences or full contexts have been restored. Today the bones are distributed and stored over the world <a href="./3.___00_TBI_statistics_100year.htm">(SunYaBin)</a>. Although there exist forgeries, we believe the percentage is less than 1%[ForgeRate]. The materials we have today is same reliable as the 981 texts of scroll rolls discovered in dead sea between 1946 and 1956.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Documentations</strong><br />
				<br />
				In order to allow all scholars to study TBI world widely, the inscriptions on bones have to be copied into documents. Our pioneers had made great achievents on this tediou tremendious task. Large mount of inscriptings were manually copied into books and pulished. Recent years, the documented data gradually began to move to computer and internet.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Consolidation</strong><br />
				<br />
				There are about 600,000 characters has been&nbsp;collected[TotNumOfTBI].&nbsp;Although none of two characters are exactly the same, there is a lot of similarities among the recoreded characters. So far, around max of 46,635 distinct samples of characters have been collected from the bones[LiZhongKun][ChenNianFu][ShenJianHua]. About 10,00~6,000 different individual Chinese characters have been considered as standalone characters. Between 1,200 and 1,500 characters have been recognized. The chineseetymology.org could well demonstrate the work of consolidations.<br />
				<br />
				The consolidation process is subject to personal subjective biases and analysis method used. This process may need repeated for many times and large amount of human resources and times. This paper will use the achieved consolidated 10,000~6,000 characters mainly from Jiaguwen Zixin Table[ShenJianHua], ChenNianFu&#39;s list[ChenNianFu], chant.org, chineseetymology.org and zdic.net. After further consodilation, the total number could be reduced to about 5,000~6,000 characters.<br />

				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Greatest Common Factor</strong> (GCF)<br />
				<br />
				Repetedly applying GCF method on all consolidated characters, we could get all roots of TBI. Fortunately almost all root characters can be found in the stand alone characters. Our results show that the ratio of the root and compound characters is about 1:5. Hence, the number of studied objects was reduced from about 6,000 to 1,200. More important, the roots contain the most essential information with minimium redundancies.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Classification</strong></p>
				<p>
					All roots characters we got from GCF can be divided into known and unknown two groups.<br />
					<br />
					For the known characters, we borrowed the terminology from traditional classification methods[ChineseCharacters6FormationPrinciples], and divided them into logogram and pictogram two parts.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Logogram<br />
						Logograms are commonly known also as &quot;ideograms&quot;. An ideogram or ideograph is a graphic symbol that represents an idea or concept. The logograms represented the abstraction and most central intelligent part of all TBI.<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
					<li>
						Pictogram<br />
						A pictogram, also called a pictogramme, pictograph, or simply picto. It conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical tangible object.<br />
						<br />
						&nbsp;</li>
				</ol>
				See <a href="./3.__01_010_Root_Character_Distribution.htm">(root char distr)</a>.
				<p>
					&nbsp;</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
		<p>
			The logograms represented the abstraction and most central intelligent part of all TBI. Through our sampling process analysis, it demonstrated that the ultimate roots logograms we collected and studied are full, minized and essential data from whole TBI. The conclusion made based on these data can be objective with minimium prejudices and hence will be reliable.&nbsp;</p>
