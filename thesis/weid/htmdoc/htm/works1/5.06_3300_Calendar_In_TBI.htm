			Calendar Of TBI</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Brief Background</strong><br />
			<br />
			Many monumental works that systematically discussed the structure of the Shang calendar had been done and released[GuoMoRuo_ZhongGuoShiGao][DongZuobing_YinCalender].&nbsp;There achieved many common grounds among scholars, for example, it was widely agreed that calendar used in Shang was lunar-solar calendar; A month had 29 (little month) or 30 (big month) days alternatively arranged in the year[GuoMoRuo_ZhongGuoShiGao].&nbsp;However, it was still not clear how the leap year worked, how the 13th-month was used. Many scholars even did not believe there was a 14th month existing in the calendar. This paper applied math statistic method and turned out some simple but significant discoveries.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Statistic Analysis Method</strong></p>
		<p>
			First, we collected all inscriptions that contains character &#39;month&#39; from all discovered oracle bones inscriptions, no matter it is partial or full, and put them into a database. Then, we find out the types of &#39;month&#39; from it, and put that results into a table. (See table-1: Types of months in Shang)</p>
		<p>
			For each type of &#39;month&#39;, we continue to count the number of inscriptions that contains the days used getather with that type of month. We put all results into one table. (See table-2: The days and months statistics) The table will help us to find out the numeric relatsionship between days and months, and to understand the kind of calendar it was used.</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, for each type of month, no matter what type of days it was used, we calculate totatal number of inscriptions that contains &#39;rain&#39; and put them into a table. (See table 3: Rain Frequency Statistic) This table will help us to analysis the cliemate feature at Shang through the comparison of today&#39;s climate data. See table-5: The climate data at Anyang .</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Days</strong></p>
		<p>
			We converted the sexagenary date frequent value from column Tn1,Tn0,Tn in table 2: <a href="./5.___06_Tbl_Month_Date_Usage_Map.htm">Months and Dates Usages Statistics In OBI</a> into curve graphics, See figure-8.&nbsp; Daily Activity Freq. We can find following interesting conclusions about the day at Shang,</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The sexagenary cyclical system was used for day-count -- there was 60 days per week.</li>
			<li>
				The first day (Jia-Zi) was more active in TBI. (&nbsp; Jia-Zi day frequency of usage is higher than others )</li>
			<li>
				Every 10 days from the first day was more active than others in&nbsp; TBI. (refer to hit rate)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<br />
			<strong>Months</strong></p>
		<p>
			From the Table-1: <a href="./5.___06_Tbl_Month_Date_Usage_Map.htm">Types of months</a>, we found that there are totally 14 different squential numbered months used in OBI. We also found 13 different alias names used for the month. According to traditions and scholars[DongZuobing_YinCalender],&nbsp;we know that the Zheng(正) month was the alias name for the first month.&nbsp; Hence. in our calculation, we will add Zhen-month on the 1st-month.We still don&#39;t known other alias months so far.<br />
			<br />
			Based on the freqency data for each month in table-2, we drawed days distribution graphics for each month. (See figure-9: Number of Days in 14 Months a Year) We can find that the freqency for the 10th-month was much higher than any other months. There are two possibilities. One is that the number of days in the 10th-month are more than any others. The second one is that the 10th-month contains important festival days, and more records were left. Obviously, the later one makes more sense in days distribution among the 14 months.</p>
		<p>
			The 14th month has only two records. This extremely low usage rates suggested that it would be used for the leap year only. We can find that the average frequencies for months between 1 and 12 are 2 or 3 times higher than 13th month.&nbsp; This kind of distribution suggest that 1-12 month has average of 29.5 days, and 13th month has 11.<br />
			<br />
			Although the data evidence is very weak, we can still find that alternatively the odd month is greater than even from 1 to 6 month,&nbsp; and it is in reverse&nbsp; from 7-12 month. This distribution suggest a symmetric normal months alternative days.</p>
		<p>
			We put our analysis results in table,&nbsp; we can condcut that the calendar that used in OBI was a natural lunar-solar calendar.&nbsp;(See Table-10:Number of Days for Each Month in OBI) Such suggestion can best match the results of calcuated probabilities of the days for each month.&nbsp; (See table-11:Calculation of Propability of Numbers of Days For Each Month).The properties of the month can be summarized as following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				There were max of 14 months in a year in TBI.</li>
			<li>
				The 14th month had only 1 day and appeared only in leap year.</li>
			<li>
				The 13th month has fixed 11 days.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				For full regualr month from 1 to 6, the odd month had 30 days, and even one had 29.</li>
			<li>
				The 10th month was very activities than all other months.</li>
			<li>
				Zhen month was already known as the alias name for the first month. Other alias name could not be confirmed here.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<strong>First Month of Year</strong></p>
		<p>
			If we analysis the statistic data for the rain among the 14 months (See Figure-7), we can find that the highest frequent raining occured on the 4th-month[WangXinguang2008]. It is different from the highest percipitation&nbsp;month of&nbsp;July in&nbsp;Climate data for Anyang (1971&ndash;2000). If we consider the 4th-month as one in lunar calendar used today, which was usually around in May, they sill don&#39;t match. However, if we think of the 14th-month as one in Jewish Calendar, then the frequent rain curve can well match the percipitaion curve in climate data of today at Anyang.&nbsp; This suggested that the 1st month in OBI was same as the Nisan&nbsp; -- the first month in a Jewish Calender is always between March and April in Gregorian calendar -- the early spring around equinox.</p>
		<p>
			This results caused 10th-month of OBI to fall in between Janunary and Feburay -- when it is the new year spring festival in China lunar calendar used today -- the first day of first month of a year started in winter solstice. This could well explain why the freqency for the 10th-month was much higher than any other months.</p>
		<p>
			Although the percipitation may change every year, the four seasonal features, the percipitation curve line, which was mainly determined by its anstronomy movement and its geological location, should essentially keep the same unchanged.&nbsp; We can conclude that the so-called Yin calendar used at Shang was related to the Jewish calendar.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Years</strong></p>
		<p>
			Although the Yin calendar is quite different from the Chinese lunar calendar, they still have many interited common features. We can find that the most active festival in a year is kept as the same time around winter soltice. The alias name of the first month (Zhen) was still in use, although its meaning was complete different.&nbsp; The leap year is still in use, inspite that the usage method is different. Both are lunar-solar calender.</p>
		<p>
			It is interesting that the sexagenary cyclical system that was used as day-count in Yin calendar became to be the year-count in lunar calendar.&nbsp; There were no year-count at Shang. Maybe we have not found it yet. According to the historic book ShiJi (史记 十二诸侯年表), the earliest year-count started with GenShen 庚申 (841 BC). Since the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC - 8 AD), the sexaginary cyclical year-count began pupular, and used as lunar calendar until today. Based on this mapping, the closest year of Jia-Zi(甲子) to 1 AD in Gregorian calender is the 4 AD -- only three years differences.&nbsp;<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<br />
			<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			<br />
			Based on above analysis, we can find that, although the Yin calendar shared many commons with lunar calendar, like, lunisolar, leap, etc. it has following important features:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Yin calendar is related to Jewish calendar in that the first month of a year, also called&nbsp; &#39;Zhen&#39; month in Yin calendar, starts between March and April.</li>
			<li>
				Yin calendar has tatally 14 different months. The 14th-month had only one day and was deserved for leap year. The 13th-month has 11 days. The other months&nbsp; have 29 or 30 days for each.</li>
			<li>
				The sexaginary cyclic system were used for day-count for 60 days per week. There was no year-count.</li>
