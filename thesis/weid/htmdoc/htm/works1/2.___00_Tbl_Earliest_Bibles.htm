				<div>
					Through recent archeological examination of the 66 books in the bible we have today, scholars have concluded that the Christian Bible is a trustworthy and reliable book.</div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					There are more than 24,000 partial and complete manuscript copies of the New Testament. These manuscript copies are very ancient and they are available for inspection now.</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					There are also some 86,000 quotations from the early church fathers and several thousand Lectionaries (church-service books containing Scripture quotations used in the early centuries of Christianity). Bottom line: the New Testament has an overwhelming amount of evidence supporting its reliability. There are enough quotations from the early church fathers that even if we did not have a single copy of the Bible, scholars could still reconstruct all but 11 verses of the entire New Testament from material written within 150 to 200 years from the time of Christ.<br />
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					Scholars have discovered that there are some 150,000 &quot;variants&quot; in the many thousands of manuscript copies we possess of the New Testament. This may seem like a staggering figure to the uninformed mind. But to those who study the issue, the numbers are not so damning as it may initially appear. Indeed, a look at the hard evidence shows that the New Testament manuscripts are amazingly accurate and trustworthy. To begin, we must emphasize that out of these 150,000 variants, 99 percent hold virtually no significance whatsoever. Many of these variants simply involve a missing letter in a word; some involve reversing the order of two words (such as &quot;Christ Jesus&quot; instead of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;); some may involve the absence of one or more insignificant words.Really, when all the facts are put on the table, only about 50 of the variants have any real significance - and even then, no doctrine of the Christian faith or any moral commandment is effected by them.<br />
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					In these Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at Qumran in 1947, we have Old Testament manuscripts that date about a thousand years earlier (150 B.C.) than the other Old Testament manuscripts then in our possession (which dated to A.D. 900). The significant thing is that when one compares the two sets of manuscripts, it is clear that they are essentially the same, with very few changes. The fact that manuscripts separated by a thousand years are essentially the same indicates the incredible accuracy of the Old Testament&#39;s manuscript transmission.<br />
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					A full copy of the Book of Isaiah was discovered at Qumran. Even though the two copies of Isaiah discovered in Qumran Cave 1 near the Dead Sea in 1947 were a thousand years earlier than the oldest dated manuscript previously known (A.D. 980), they proved to be word for word identical with our standard Hebrew Bible in more than 95 percent of the text.<br />
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					The 5 percent of variation consisted chiefly of obvious slips of the pen and variations in spelling. From manuscript discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls, Christians have undeniable evidence that today&#39;s Old Testament Scripture, for all practical purposes, is exactly the same as it was when originally inspired by God and recorded in the Bible.</div>
