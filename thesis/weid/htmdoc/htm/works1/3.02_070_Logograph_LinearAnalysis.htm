			Elementary Analysis</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			The logogram is the CIA of TBI. All the intellectual information including the origins, design, laws, believes and human life ultimate purpose etc. are all integrated in the logograms with high density. The simplest and most complicated, the easiest and most difficult, the visible and the invisible, the known and unknown, as well as possiblely the authentics and the forgeries, the sacred and the evil etc. coexist together in about six hundreds of logograms. TBI study should start with logograms analysis.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. The Laws of Lines (LoL)</strong></p>
		<p>
			When creating a intellegent system like the Chinese writing languages for certain purpose, there have to have the design principles or laws at first. If we repeatedly applying GCF onto logograms, eventually we could got the minimium undividable objects -- various type of lines. Further investigation of all other characters of TBI could show that, there is no dot, no any punctuation marks in TBI writing system. The only dots that could be found in couple of pictograms[AllCharactersWithDots] among whole TBI was actually due to its limited space for writing in TBI. We can conclude that all characters were made of lines only -- the first Law of Line (LoL) in Chinese writing system.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			This law told us that the smallest unit or the most fundamental undividable element in any characters of TBI is a line. In another word, any lines in TBI is a character. From OOA, viewpoint, the lines are the simplest, minimium objects or characters in TBI writing system. By analyzing all kinds of lines in TBI, we can conclude that, a line can be classified into three catagories. In each catagories, they have different types. </p>
            See Table <a href="./3.__02_070_Laws_of_Lines.htm">(LofL)</a>
		
		<p>
			In theory, types of lines are unlimited. But in TBI, we have only five different kinds of lines used in writing system of TBI.</p>
		
        See table <a href="./3.__02_070_Type_of_Lines_Statistics.htm">(**)</a>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoints, the straight long horizontal line can be a standalone character, it has three SC children characters, namely two, three and four in the numeration table (N-Table). The straight long vertical and long curved lines, as a standalong character, has no any significant children characters. The sloped straight line as well as the short lines did not exist in standalone characters at all. The roles of all kinds of lines in TBI can be clearly seen in the Numeration table (N table) in TBI.</p>
		 See table <a href="./3.__02_070_N-Table.htm">(**)</a>
		<p>
			By combination of statistic and OOA methods, we can get RF list from N-Table. Noticed that the RF list in N-table follows Zipf&#39;s rule, also is consistent to RF for TBI. Obviously, the straight horizontal line has highest rate in RF. Besides, from the table, we can find that, regardless the directions, the straight lines were more frequently used than the curved lines -- the stright lines domain the writing system. From the order in N-table, we can conclude that &quot;the straight horizontal line (SHL) is the first, the straight vertical line (SVL) is the last&quot;.</p>
		<p>
			Among all single line characters, only the HSL has most three pure Self-Cloned-Children (SCC). This numbe is also unique in all TBI. The SCC is not very common in TBI[AllSCCInTBI]. A character with three SCC is a very special phenonemon in TBI. The multiple consective SCC played emphesized role to tell us that &quot;the first one has to be SHL, the last has to be SVL&quot;. No change was permitted. Any changes in one of them could change the whole system in meaning.</p>
		<p>
			From the priorities and specialities of SHL demonstrated among single lines characters, with OOA, we can conclude that SHL is the parent of all other lines. In another word, the vertical, curved or any other types of lines can be considered as the variations in forms derived from the SHL. Further, with OOA, we can conclude that, SHL is the very first created charcter among all in Chinese writing system -- the SHL is the entrt point or the beginning of TBI -- the second Law of Line for Chinese writing system.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			all characters were inherited from the horizontal line.&nbsp; (2)</p>
		<p>
			The LoL was kept in history for thousands of year until today even in simplified writing system. The western styles of punctuation marks we used today in Chinese documentation just started after 1919 five-four movement[PunctuationMarks]. The LoL is one of significantly features that is different from other phonetic writing system in the world.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. About &#39;One&#39;</strong></p>
		<p>
			From LoL that all characters in TBI were directly or indirectly made from the SHL, hence the meaning of the SHL is very critical for TBI study since every character will contain the meaning of it. In Chinese writing system, the literal meaning of the SHL in TBI was widely and consistently regarded as &#39;one&#39; in long history -- it was still in use for today.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Indeed what the SHL represented is more than the meaning for &#39;one&#39; expressed in way of the concept in math. This can be clearly seen when we compared with TBI with Romans in N-Table.&nbsp; The horizontal line is not merely used as a mark for the incremental numeric counting -- it was interruped at four, and starting from five, the numeration system began to switch to new way -- using pictograms and logograms. This phenonmenon is call IPv4 in N-table. (Incremental Interruption Phenonmenon)</p>
		<p>
			To better understand the &#39;one&#39;, we have to look at its three derived characters in N-table. Form OOA viewpoints, among all charaters in TBI, there are only four characters that used the self-cloned aggregation method to generate its children greater than four. (See Table of Self-Clones Objects And Their Arrangements[AllSCCInTBI]) As contrast, the first four characters in N-table differentiated to others in consistently vertical arrangement.</p>
		<p>
			There is no character in TBI to denote &#39;zero&#39;. So the character &#39;one&#39; also means the beginning from nothing, as well as how and where the begining was created. From the characters design and generation&#39;s viewpoints, we can see that &#39;one&#39; was created from LoL. Such kind of meaning can be proved through the soft evidence -- the famous quote from the classical books. &quot;The law produce one, one produces two, two produces three, three produce all&quot;. -- LaoZi. (&nbsp; &quot;道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物&quot;) <a href="./4.___00_Tbl_About_1_In_DaoDeJing.htm">(aoZiDaoDeJing)</a>.</p>
		<p>
			We could not track the very original version of this quote. But except the &#39;four&#39;, the quote and N-table can be perfectly integrated togehter to explain not only the meaning of single first character of &#39;one&#39;, but also the meaning of the N-table -- how the writing system was created, as well as the meaning of how the world and universe was created -- the way in philosophy, believes, or religions.</p>
		<p>
			With the original N-table, the original quote could be &quot;The law produce one, one produces two, two produces three, three produce four, four produce all&quot;. -- LaoZi. (&nbsp; &quot;道生一，一生二，二生三，三生四，四生万物&quot;. Considering the ealiest time of the quote (after about 470 BC) and the etymology of &#39;four&#39; (changed before 255 BC[ChineseEtymology]), the quote we have today was likely recorded or spreaded after the modification of &#39;four&#39;. Although the basic idea is very similar with or without &#39;four&#39; in quote, we can see that how the modification of characters affect the contexts of the whole Chinese literure as well as its culture and believes.</p>
		<p>
			More over, we can conclude the first character &#39;one&#39; that belong to the writing system was created from outside of its writing system -- in another world through the LoL. It demonstrated that the writing system was with the law at the beginning. The LoL is above the writing system --&nbsp; the writing system is under the LoL. Such high philosophy concept of undividable up-down relationship between the writing system and LoL expressed in the character &#39;one&#39; was somehow similar to the ideas expressed in John 1:1-3[NIV John1:1-3].</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The purpose to enforce the &#39;one&#39; to be written in SHL can well be explained through visual thinking and BE method. The straight line is like a straight road, rightousness etc. The SHL was in the middle in character, the vision of earth horizontal line in photography that filled with the blue sky, the white cloud, the yellow ground, green grass or trees, or the ocean, the sunshine, the moon, stars, and so on. to split the space into two -- up and down, heaven and earth (See Gen 1:1~10) More imagination includes the directions from east and the west (Matt 8:11[NIV Matt 8:11]), the open arms, &#39;come&#39;, &#39;love&#39; etc. All of them can be consistent -- a polymorphism in OOA.</p>
		<p>
			Any characters derived from &#39;one&#39;, no matter what it it looks like, what actually it expressed in particular for concreate cases, contain the same messages of what &#39;one&#39; had in high abstractions. It filled in everywhere in chinese writing system, literature documents, culture, ideologies believes. The characters, writing system, history, culture are all undivided and integrated one unit -- the extended meaning for &#39;one&#39;. Any modification in the characters will affect the whole. The changes of characters reflected the changes of the thughts, history, culture and its associated societies.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. Characters Population</strong></p>
		<p>
			Through the LoL, it only generated one fundamental root character. It was through OOA method that it will populate all other characters. From OOA, there are two ways to derive the new characters from the root -- variation and encapusulation.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Variation<br />
				The variation means to generate a new character by changing the forms of the root without adding or deleting any thing. All different types of lines, including the closed circular one, are considered as the variation from &#39;one&#39;.&nbsp;Four of them exist in standalone character. (See table)<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Polymorphism<br />
				To use multiple different objects to represent the same meaning, or to use one same image of object to represent different meanins in consistency.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Aggregation<br />
				Single line variation can only populate the limited number of five new characters. To produce more, encapsulation in OOA method has to be applied in order to combine multiple lines to generate new characters. This led to the classification of Self-Clone, Mixed Aggregation (MA). Through the number of lines we have double-line characters, tripple-line characters, quadrual-line characters, multiple-line characters (for example, the pictograms), and so on.<br />
				<br />
				1) Self-Cloned Aggregation (SCA)<br />
				To form a new character through increase the number of object by duplication of itself. Such children is called SCC.<br />
				<br />
				2) Mixed Aggregation (MA)<br />
				To form a new character through increase the number of mixed different objects. Such children is called HCC.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Following tables demonstrated the characters population process with OOA method.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Single-Line Characters -- Variations from the root.
				See <a href="./3.__02_070_Lines-1_charcters.htm">(*)</a>.
				<a> note: the total of single line individual root logograms in TBI is only about 4.</a><br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Double-Line Character-- encapsulation of two single-line characters.
				See <a href="./3.__02_070_Lines-2_charcters.htm">(*)</a>.
				<a>Notes: the total double-line individual root logograms is about 13, altars could be considered as variant children of cross.</a><br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Tripple-Line Character -- encapsulation of three single-line characters.<br />
				<a href="./3.__02_070_Lines-3_charcters.htm">(*)</a>
				Nots: total of three-line individual characters is about 3.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Quadrual-Line Character -- encapsulation of four single-line characters.
				<a href="./3.__02_070_Lines-4_charcters.htm">(*)</a>
				Nots: total of four-line individual characters is about 3.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				There are no five-line characters in TBI. As we can see from above, among all characters made of single-line characters only, the double-line characters has most in number of children. Among the double-line characters, the cross is the most special -- an lot of characters take the shape from the cross. It has most variation children, their offsprings major elements for the compound words. <a class="m">9</a><br />
				<br />
				<br />
				See <a href="./3.__02_070_Sample_Of_Combination.htm">(*)</a>.
				<br />
				<br />
				See <a href="./3.__02_070_Sample_Of_Iconization.htm">(*)</a>.
				<br />
				Note that those characters have features of both picture and logos. Also, each of them has their children and grandchildren. As a result, the root of &#39;seven&#39; formed a biggest variation inherited family in the root logograms. (see &#39;seven&#39; family)<br />
				<br />
				Besides, those root logograms are most active as compared with other root logograms and formed large amount of new characters through the combination method. As a result, there exist a biggest family rooted from the &#39;seven&#39; through variation or combination method in the whole writing system, It covered most of the characters including the unknown. See samples.<br />
				<br />
				<a href="./3.__02_070_Sample_InheritanceOfSevem.htm">(*)</a>
				<br />
				Among the combined inherited children from &#39;seven&#39;, the character &#39;son&#39; is the most active root element. It has many variation inherited children and grandchildren, as well as large amount of children with the combination. (See &#39;son&#39; family.)<br />
				<br />
				From the process of characters population with OOA method, we can find the biggest main trunk in the whole tree is the One-Cross-Son (OCS). Nearly all logograms are the offsprings of OCS. The whole tree is like character a king in royal family.<br />

			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1.5. Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			Through elementary analysis on the logograms, we got the Laws of Lines (LoL):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				all characters were made of lines only.</li>
			<li>
				all characters were inherited from the straight horizontal line (HSL).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The LoL is one of significantly features that is different from other phonetic writing system in the world. The HSL has more meaning than &#39;one&#39; in math. All characters were populated through OOA method. The chinse writing system is a OOA system -- among them the One-Cross-Son (OCS) is the biggest family.</p>

			<h3>
				Logo Linear Analysis</h3>
			<p>
				There are about 400 logo roots. There are two steps in linear logo analysis process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Collect all words that have same numbers of lines in a group. (n=1,2,3,,,,, n is the number of lines of the group)</li>
				<li>
					Find&nbsp;(MFU) most frequently&nbsp;used word for each group and put other in a list based on its order in frequency (n, n.1, n.2, n,3,&nbsp;,,,,,,,,)&nbsp;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				If we input&nbsp;above results into database and&nbsp;tranfer each word into&nbsp;a <a href="../../../../oojs/jqtreeview/app">tree structure</a>, we can discover that logo&nbsp;tbi has two types of inheritance in log tbi word population.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					clone based multiplication: make itself different from one another and its original parent by copy itself.&nbsp; It is essentially a duplication process: It produces two genetically identical&nbsp;word from a single &quot;parent&quot; word.</li>
				<li>
					mutation based multiplication: generating a new word that are distinct from one another and from the original parent word by changing the shape or repositioning inside of its word.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				The most important thing thru the two steps linear logo analysis is that the fundimental root word of&nbsp;&nbsp;logo tbi&nbsp;is&nbsp;exposed in front of us. The whole tbi words are not complicated any more. They all comes from one single simplest word ONE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Virutually all tbi are generated fron single root word ONE thru either clone or mutation or both.&nbsp; This is similar to biology, a person begin as a single cell.</p>
			<p>
				Due to&nbsp;its paticular role in tbi system, the word ONE is kept consistently to be used until today and never ever changed both in writing and meaning&nbsp;through out more than three thousands years with all types of dynsties and societies. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				The word ONE is kept in top 100 most frequently used words until today. Not only it&nbsp; represents as the first in numeric sequences words, but also it implies&nbsp;the begining of the whole tbi system.&nbsp;Futher more, the shape of the word itsself also means the begining of the bondary between up and down, the&nbsp;begining of&nbsp;heaven and earth, the&nbsp;begining from&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;to all things. ONE is the simplest in tbi, however its study could never ends. It is the key to enter the kingdom of tbi system. Every one who wants to learn tbi or chinese should start with this.</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				We use coding convention n.i.j.k to label the logographs. n is the number of the lines it has. For the word that have same number of lines, they are distinguished by index number i. For different words that inherited from n.i, we use j as children index to present. and so on for grandchildren.</p>
