			Biblical Evidence (BE) Method</h2>
		<p>
			The EZ method is one of most powerful aproaches in Chinese archeology study. However, there exists fatal issue in its soft evidence -- none of Chinese ancient books we have today are completely reliable enough to testify against others. In many situations, the Chinese ancient books itself are not clear and need to be verified by other hard evidences. This leads us to introduce the bible to supersede Chinese ancient books and proposed the Biblical Evidence (BE) method -- that is to use canonical bible as primary reference to examine and explore the TBI.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. About the Fatal Defects Of Chinese Ancient Books</strong></p>
		<div>
			China is one of the richest countries with ancient books in the world. In general, all Chinese books before the end of Qing dynasty(1616-1912) are called Chinese ancient books中國古典典籍. In history, many different ways were used to catagory these Chinese ancient books. For example, in official SQKS (SiKuQuanShu四库全书1771--1781)[SiKuWholeBook], nearly all important Chinese books before emperor Qian(1711-1799), totally about 93,551 volums, about 8 billion characterss[GuTingLong] in royal liberay, were catagoried into four major divisions: 经(Scripture)、史(History)、子(Son)、集(Collections). Each division contains subdivisions and so on.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Chinese scholars prefer to classify Chinese ancient books before Qin dynasty(221 BC - 207 BC) as pre-Qin documents 先秦文学(献)[HanShu_JinShiSanWangZhuang]. Many greatest creative thinkers, titled as son (子zi in Chinese), suddenly emerged during around 500 BC, for example, Kong-Zi, Meng-Zi Lao-Zi, Zhuang-Zi etc. and founded the literature, thoughts and culture for China. The earliest Chinese books, &quot;Four Books and Five Classics&quot;, started to spread during that period. After that, especially after Han Dynasty(221BC-221AD) there are no figures, books, or thoughts as significant as those ever appeared in China.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			When we disscuss about the Chinese ancient books, it does not include the Chinese Buddaism books, which is about 8899 volumes with 7 billion characters[XiongJuan]. Chinese Buddaism began to appear after Eastern Han Dynasty 东汉(25AD-220AD) and quickly flourished after Tang Dynasty唐朝(618-907). For nearly two thousands of years, it gradually rooted in daily life and became the domain of Chinese thoughts and culture. However, Buddhasim books are mainly the translations of foreign texts and the mixtures of other modified thoughts, they are hard to trace back and have little or no value for pure original Chinese culture study.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Although Chinese ancient books are extremely aboundant, they all, especially the pre-Qin documents we have today, contain more or less following fatal defects:</div>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Destructed:<br />
				Chinese ancient books experienced serials of destructions in hisotory. There are many books only having names but no body today. For example, [TheBookoftheMusic] [TheBambooAnnals] [ShanHaiJin] [LaoZivsWenZi] [HuangLang] were mentioned but disappeared in history. It was very common for Chinese classical books that chapters of books were lost. (Eg. [ShiJing] [BookOfShangShu] [ZhouYi] [ChunQiu] [LiJi] [SiMaQian_ShiJi4]). Scholars believe that the missing was mainly due to political or military destroy in history. The earliest example is Buring-Book-Burying-Scholar 焚书坑儒(213-212 BC)[_FenShaoKengRu_]. Indeed, Chinese has a tradtion that, whenever a new book was compiled, its original one will be burn out into ashes in order to keep singluar version to reduce confusions. For example, 四库全书(SiKu Whole Books, 1711~1799)[SiKuWholeBook].<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Modified:<br />
				During the books transition process in history, there were large mount of modifications between the old version and new one.&nbsp;The typical example is&nbsp;<a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Earliest_Chinese_Books_Laozi_DaoDeJing.htm">LaoZi Dao De Jing</a>.&nbsp;Types of modification can be summarized as:<br />
				&nbsp;a). characters modification.<br />
				&nbsp;b). sequence of sentences modification.<br />
				&nbsp;c). adding or deleting characters, phrases, paragraphs, or even chapters.<br />
				Such modification could be due to the&nbsp;misprint by accident, but mostly&nbsp;are on purpose personally or officially and politically.&nbsp;There does not exist any permnant standards, cross dynasty legistrations, or clear moral laws in books transition process in China history.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Plagarism/Forgery<br />
				It is hard to distinguish in documents between plagiarism抄襲 and paraphrase重述. It provides a chance for&nbsp;infringement&nbsp;to allow the forged books to keep appearance in order to fill in the lost ones in history. For example, [ShanHaiJin] [GanShiXingJing] are widely considered as forgery. The mixture of them made it impossible&nbsp;for us to identify the authentics and difficult to study ancient culture. For example, medical doctor&nbsp;Yanzi[] would live&nbsp;300 years based on records in documents. Plagarism and forgery became one of the basic features not only for Chinese documents, but also for its whole culture, specially during the great Tang dynasty[LiJi]. Today we can also see it from forgery TBI[ForgedTBI] [ChineseEtymologyFakeTBI] to industry technologies both hardware and software that is &quot;made in China&quot;.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			We can also summarized three basic features of Chinese ancient books.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Abundant:<br />
				The number of book, number of families, the versions of each books etc. are so rich and complicated that no one can read them all in his life.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Choas:<br />
				Various versions from different times, paraphrase, plagiarim, forgery are mixed together. It is hard to distinguish between the truth and false, the confusing or the depth of thoughts. The various formats of text (ancient or modern) and characte sets (traditional or simplified) make it more difficult for people to learn. The more we want to clean or simplify them, the more messy and complicated they are. Chinese ancient books are unthrowable&nbsp;garbages&nbsp;and uncleanable&nbsp;resources.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Mutable:<br />
				The meaning of Chinese ancient books are not rigid constant but changeable based on the interpreters. At one hand they are inequivable and uncertain. On the other hand, they are so flexible that they can be compatible to any other cultures or thoughts.</li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			There is no distinction ever existed between a primary and a secondary source in ancient books in China[ChineseHistoryHandbook]. These types of defects and features tremendiously depreciated the value of its wealthy, weakened the capability of EZ method. New unearthed materials usaually significantly differ and conflict to the existing documents. For example, <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Earliest_Chinese_Books_Laozi_DaoDeJing.htm">LaoZi Dao De Jing</a>. We could not know which one is original, or more closer to its original. Hence, using the Chinese classical books as the only references to study the TBI, its results not only have low credibilities, but also could mislead us to enter into an inescapable wrong direction.</div>

			<strong>2. The Connection between the Bible and China</strong></p>
		<div>
			From archeological view point, the bible has already been verified to be falsefree documents. <a class="file" href="./2.___00_Tbl_Earliest_Bibles.htm">(EarlyBibleExistance)</a>. However, many people think the bible is part of culture of Jewish and never mentioned any Chinese people at all, there seems no direct connection between Jewish and Chinses. How could the bibel be cross references for China culture study?</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			The earliest archeological hard evidence about the connection between Bible and China is the Da Qin Jin Jiao Stele (大秦景教流行中国碑) which was discovered at Xian in 1623 AD. The inscriptions mixed with Buddhasm text on the stele revealed that the Nestorian missionaries from Persia traveled to capital Xian and met the emperor, the son of heaven TangTaiZong(唐天子太宗) in 635 AD[DaQingJinJiaoStele]. It is interesting that the inscripted stele was erected on the back of the stone turtle. Although the Nestorian was denaunced as herecy by Catholic, we can find not only the connections between the bible and China, but also the indirectly physical connection between the bible and TBI.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			From historic view point, we can find that Jewish and Chinese have the same fate. Both languages are oldest in world and continniously used until today for more than three thousands of years. Both cultures were significantly destroyed and interrupted after about first century of AD for nearly two thousands: Jewish lost their holy temple and their land was occupied by Gentiles; Chinese lost their pre-Qin thoughs and their religion were domained by foreign Buddhaism. Both experienced the masscres during WWII. In early twnety century, both had significant archeological discovery:the dead sea rolls in Qumran of Israel in 1947, TBI in Anyan of China in 1889, only both believe their land is divine (promised land and ShenZhou神州[_shenzhou_in_classicbook]) and became independent in 1948 and 1949 respectively.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			If we look into inside the culture of China, we can also find many soft connection between the two. For example, during the most important Chinese Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) that occurs between Jan and Feb, traditional Chinese celebrate it in a way by sticking the red papers with blessing words around the doors or windows and call it GuNian过年, literately meaning passover a year. The term first time appeared in Chinese ancient books 鹽鐵論.繇役 (81 BC)[TieYanLun_GuoNian]. The midnight between old and new year is also called 除夕, literately meaning remove mosters, first time appeared in book風俗通義(190-200AD)[FengShuTongTi_ChuXi]. From the styles, meaning, significance and its date, Chinese New Year is very close to the story of Passover in OT, the most important festival for Jewish that begins on the 15th day of the Jewish first month of Nissan, which typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Another example is about the Chinese Yuan Xiao Festival 元宵節, the 15th day of the Chinese first month(between Jan and Feb). Chinese people celebrate it by hanging the big latterns as well as the food of boiling rice ball at night . The earliest term could be found in 三國演義(1350-1400 AD)[SanGuoYanYi_YuanXiao]. 元 literately means &#39;top, head, first, alpha&#39;, related to divine. The character 宵Xiao literately means &#39;night&#39;, the same meaning but less common than 夜Yue. But, the character宵 carry the pictogram information related to building or house. Chinese Yuan Xiao festival can be compared with the Jewish festival of Hanukkah recorded in NT. It usually lasts eight days from the 25th day of Kislev (in December), marked by the successive kindling of eight lights and accompanied by traditional games, rituals and food (Matzah ball) etc. and commemorates the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem of 165 BC. Although such connection between them still lacks evidence and is augurable, we can find that both cultures are easily compatiable despite the remote distance and complete different languages and races.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			We can enumerate more cases like that[OtherConnectCasesForBibleAndChina]. The discovery of silk-road can also enhance the possibility of such connections. But, to further expose such inter culture relationship, we have to switch to&nbsp;Stimulus Diffusion theory and&nbsp;Devolution&nbsp;theory which will be discussed later.&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			More important, regarding about the references, the bible is the only concise rigid wholistic book for thousands of years in the world, that does not have any defects that Chinese books have. All culture and thoughts can be considered as part of and being derived from the biblical accounts. Out final results show that to use bible as cross references for Chinese archeology study can not only overcome fatal issues of Chinese ancient books, but also successfully expose the internal connection between the biblical account and TBI.</div>
		<div>

			<div>
				<strong>3. Conclusion</strong></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				Chinese ancient books are aboundant but choas, mutable and unreliable. To use Chinese ancient books as primary soft evidence greatly weakened the credibility of EZ method. There are already many inter culture evidence between Bible and Chinese culture. To use the canonical Bible as primary cross reference to examine and explore the TBI can not only overcome the fatal issue of traditional EZ method, but also bring a new way to study the TBI as well as its literature, culture and thoughts.</div>
