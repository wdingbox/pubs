			Classification</h2>
		<p>
			Introduction</p>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoints, there is no difference between logograms and pictograms -- all characters are the children of root &#39;one&#39;. Depending on the visual thinking, a character can be both pictogram and logogram. Character &#39;one&#39; for example, when we think of it in abstraction in math, philosophy, religions etc, it belongs to logogram. If we think of it as a horizontal sea line, then it belong to pictogram.</p>
		<p>
			However, from the characters searching viewpoints, the logograms has simple and clear tree structures and hence is better than the pictogram in OOA system. For searching the tangible objects for pictograms, the shoping catagories is still the best way.</p>
		<p>

		<h3>
			2. Pictogram Classifications</h3>
		<p>
			Based on the common modern knowledge in our daily life, we use following shopping catagory (SC) hierachy model to classify all root pictograms into&nbsp;a structured tree.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				&nbsp;living things&nbsp;<br />
				1. animals<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. animal&nbsp;<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. animal as whole (ox, lamb, horse, birds, turtle etc)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. part of&nbsp;animal (head, body etc)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. humam<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. man as whole (man, woman, son etc.)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. part of body&nbsp; (head, eyes, ear, teeth, mouth, nose, hand, foot etc)<br />
				2. plants (trees, rices etc)</li>
			<li>
				none-living things<br />
				1. natural (sun, moon, rain, etc)<br />
				2. man-made (clothes, food, housing, transportations, culture&nbsp;etc)<br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>

		<h3>
			3. Unknown Characters</h3>
		<p>
			Though OOA method, almost all of root characters are organically linked together and form a network system. There still exist limited number of characters that could not be covered in the system. The reasons could be:</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			3.1 Mistakes.</p>
		<p>
			Each charater was extremely expansive not only in materials but also the efforts and techniques required at TBI times. Besides, due to the sacred religious purpose, the chance of accidental mistakes was very limited.</p>
