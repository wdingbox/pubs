			In TBI, one of the friends of the corss is the house. However, the word house in tbi denote SIX in number when it appeared standalone. (see table). If we interpret these word as six-seven, or seven-six, it does not make sense.&nbsp;Thru the friends of SIX, we know that SIX can also denotes the house, just like the visual image it displayed.</p>
		<p>
			Among all tbi, we can not find any other words&nbsp;like ONE-HOUSE, TWO-HOUSE, THREE-HOUSE, FOUR-HOUSE, FIVE-HOUSE, SIX-HOUSE, EIGHT-HOUSE, NINE-HOUSE.&nbsp; But we found many words that is compose of house and cross or the variant of cross.</p>
		<p>
			The special relationship between cross and house in TBi&nbsp;can be visually linked to the relationship between the cross and church. A church that have not cross is not called church. We can find numerous image of churches&nbsp;of today that is similar to words in tbi. This&nbsp;facts provides&nbsp;hard evidence that&nbsp;tbi&nbsp;has internal&nbsp;connections to bible.&nbsp;</p>
