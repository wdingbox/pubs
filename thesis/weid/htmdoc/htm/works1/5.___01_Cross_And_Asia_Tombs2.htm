			<strong>The Cross and Asia&nbsp;Tombs</strong></p>
		<p>
			From the birdview map, we can easily find that all grand tombs in Yinxu royal graves garden had one common siginificant feature -- they were all structured in the shape of &#39;cross&#39;. (see&nbsp; figure: <a class="filelink" href="./5.___01_Tbl_tomb-pattern-ya.htm">the birdview of Yinxu grave garden</a>)&nbsp; Indeed the &#39;cross&#39; was very common in Chinese ancient tombs culture.</p>
		<p>
			Not only was the grave ditch strunctured in &#39;cross&#39; shape at Anyang, but also were the coffins that was burried. The archeologist found that the wood coffins in tomb 1001,1003,1004,1550&nbsp; were also built in &#39;cross&#39; shape, which was considered as more complicated as compared with regular rectangal shape coffins.[_AiLang_Angus] (see figure: <a href="./5.___01____Cross_Shaped_Coffin.htm">Illustration for M1001 Tomb Coffin</a>)&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			In the tombs, there also burried with large mount of vaious bronzes. If we use statistic method to analysie the bronzes inscriptions, we could also find that one of top three most frequently used characters on brones scriptions were the &#39;Cross&#39; too. During Shang dynasty, the &#39;cross&#39; symbols were so popular, even for those of bronzes that did not had inscriptions, we could still find many different fromat of&nbsp; &#39;corss&#39; mixed with various types of artifact. (see <a href="./5.___01____Cross_on_bronze_sample.htm">sample of bronzes with cross</a>)</p>
		<p>
			Taking it as special topic, if we study the shape of tombs in China history, we can find that, Chinese ancient tombs&nbsp; mainly had four different types in shapes: 1) Cross十, 2) Jia甲, 3) Zhong中 4) Square.&nbsp; Essentially they all directly or indirectly inherited the same common features of&nbsp; &#39;Cross&#39; shape.<br />
			<br />
			Some scholars also had noticed this kind of specialty and they found that: for practical functionalities, to build one pass road was enough to transport the digged earth, coffins, bronzes etc. It was not neccessarily to build the pass road as long as about 50-60 meters in length. For tomb 周公庙M18, it was not usable to build three pass road with 1 meter wide.[_ZhuLei] Such &#39;cross&#39; shape archtectural structrue would make unnessacerily complicated and uneffient in usage[_DuJiuming]. Some scholars explored&nbsp; the relationships between the &#39;cross&#39; shape and the chinese religious philosophy.[_WeiJianzhen] Certainly the &#39;cross&#39; shapes were not created accedentally. The &#39;cross&#39; shape were built on some religous purposes that we still don&#39;t know for today.</p>
		<p>
			The cross shape of tombs can perfectly match the bronzes or bones inscriptions character Ya(亞). This suggested its original meaning was to related to the &#39;tomb&#39;. Through OOA method in our OBI study, we could know that two different characters 十and 亞 inherited from same root. They were evolved in two different ways in writing history.  <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_tomb-Ya-etymology.htm">(see table:Ya Etymology)</a> Today, Ya(亞) were primarily used to denote the Aisa contenent due to the reasons of the large mount of bombs with cross shapes in China[_ZuoAnming]<br />
			<br />
			In long China history, the &#39;cross&#39; shape was not limited to be connected to the tombs. It also could be found in other areas, like the building archeteture. The Mingtang Piyong (or Ming Hall and Emperor) in Chang&#39;an of the Western Han Dynasty (206BC-8AD) is an example of early altar temple with &#39;cross&#39; shape.  <a href="./5.___01___Cross_in_Buildings.htm">(see picture:Cross In Altar Temple)</a></p>
		<p>
			China is not the only country to be famous and rich in the tombs with &#39;Cross&#39; shapes in Asia. If we visit the historical site of Naqsh-e Rustam located about 12 km northwest of Persepolis, in Iran, we can still see the tombs of Darius I (c. 522&ndash;486 BC), Xerxes I (c. 486&ndash;465 BC), Artaxerxes I (c. 465&ndash;424 BC), and Darius II (c. 423&ndash;404 BC). They are all at a considerable height above the ground with &#39;cross&#39; shapes. (see picture: <a href="./5.___01___Tombs_In_Iran.htm">Tombs in Iran</a>)<br />
			<br />
			Such kind of connections between the tombs and &#39;cross&#39; shapes can also be exenteded to be found world widely in ancient times, though their &#39;cross&#39; styles were different -- in Egypt it was the anhor, in Indus it was the swastika.</p>
		<p>
			If we use biblical analysis methods, such kind of mysteries can be easily resovled. Obviously the cross-shaped tombs in Yinxu were built on religious purpose -- the connection between the tomb and &#39;cross&#39; was to connect the death to eternal life.<br />
			<br />
			Today in the western and many other christian countries, it is a very common and natural practice to decerat tombs with symbol of cross. see figures: <a href="./5.___01____western_tomb-with-symbols-cross.htm">cross on western tombs</a>. It was reaonable for western people to hardly believe that&nbsp; such traditions already existed in far east at Yinxu during Shang dynasty about 1500 BC and remained thousands of years untill recently hundreds of years in China history.[_CaoBinwu] But it was sad that the Chinese decents for today have totally fogot their ancestor&#39;s such culture heritage.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<span><span>The character Ya, which originally represented such traditions as well as the subconcious unspeakable preditions sense, was changed not only in writing but also in meaming. ShuoWen (說文解字,by&nbsp;XuShen&nbsp;<strong>许慎</strong>&nbsp; 58-147 AD) explained it as the meaning of &#39;second&#39;. <span id="ShuoWen">醜也象人局背之形賈侍中說以為次弟也凡亞之屬皆從亞.&nbsp; So today the&nbsp;silver medal in Olympic is called Ya-Jun (亚军, second military) in chinese. </span>After 1840 of opia war in China, </span>the character Ya was somehow related to &#39;illness&#39; and &#39;weakness&#39;, 东亚病夫 (East Asia illful master), and once became a insulting and shameful word for Chinese people</span>. Whereas almost at the same time&nbsp;in 1850, in western, the&nbsp;red cross emblem, which is actrually the Chinese character Ya filled with red color, was invented by a&nbsp;Swiss<sup>[<a href="#_JeanHenry">JeanHenry</a>]</sup> and globally used&nbsp;in hospitals, ambulances and organization&nbsp;etc for humanrity purposes.</p>
