			Statistics Analysis</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			In our TBI study, the Statistic Analysis (SA) is a method to understand the meaning of a book or document by means of certain algorithms calculation rather than regular comprehensive reading. As number of books were kept accumulated in history, especially in recent the information explosion at eTimes, it became impossible for any person to read all or certain areas of books of the world in his life. SA is particularly powerful when the texts of the content were broken into pieces, the grammar and the meaning of the words were lost.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Usage Frequency (UF)</strong></p>
		<p>
			Word or character Usage Frequency (UF) means the number of times a word or characters repeatedly used in a book or in a time period of history. The most freqently used words or character in a book or a subject usually contain the most important topic or idea that wants to deliever.</p>
		<p>
			The analysis of sorted usage frequency words list can help us to understand the thoughts or purposes of a book without reading through the book sentence by sentence. This method is especially important when the book was destroyed into pieces, or the grammars and characters we do no know at all -- which is the case in our TBI study.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. Zipf&#39;s Curve Line</strong><br />
			<br />
			Zipf&#39;s law states that given a writing system, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.</p>
		<p>
			Our study show that, the UF we got from all discovered characters found in Anyan follows the Zepf&#39;s law. It demonstrated the TBI were a matural writing system. The top frequent characters can represent the significant meaning for the thoughts of the purpose of the TBI.&nbsp; <a href="./5.___05_Tbl-Words-Statistic-Analysis.htm">(*)</a></p>
		<p>
			Different contents or statistic method could generate different Zipf&#39;s curve lines. By comparison of them it could help us to provide useful information about the features of literures.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. Friends Analysis (FA) Method</strong></p>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoint, all characters are considered as independent objects. Multiple object can be aggreated together to form a new object -- compound character. Any objects&nbsp; encapulated in one compound characters are called the friend object to each other.</p>
		<p>
			Friends Analysis (FA) is a detective method to figure out the specific unknown root object (U) through exploring its closely related freinds in width and depth. The width means the quantities of its friends including the known and unknown. The more friends we have, the more chances we can get to know U through them. The depth means the quality of the knowledge about its friends. The deeper we know about its friends, the more accurate we know about U. Through the width and depth analysis, we can get pattern of U. Through comparison with the known object&#39;s pattern, we can identify the meaning of U.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			FA is similar to the unknown word guessing in its contents during the comprehensive reading process. In TBI study, it is very useful to decode the meaning of unkown characters with polymorphism features in OOA.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Find out all the friends of a specific unknown root character (U).</li>
			<li>
				Collect the infomation from its friends we known.</li>
			<li>
				Based on the friends information to judge the properties of U.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The more known friends of U we can get, the more certain and accuate we can assert about the U. If we know nothing about his friends, then we could not conduct anything about U. See sample in GCF and example in <a href="./4.___00_Tbl-FriendsOfCross_typical.htm">(*)</a>. FA can not only be applied to study the difficult unknown characters but also in contents for TBI.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. Friends Frequency (FF)</strong></p>
		<p>
			Friends Frequency (FF) method is the combination of UF and FA to analyze a specific root charater, that has two steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Find out all the friends of the specific root character.</li>
			<li>
				Calcuate the number of times for each friend appeared together with that specific character in compund character.</li>
			<li>
				Sort the freinds by its frequency to analyze the properties of that specific character.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The FF and FA are similar in process but differ in the analysis. FF focos on the math statistic data whereas FA on the literal meanings. To get the best result, both can be used together. (See sample in GCF)</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>6. Root Frequency (RF) </strong></p>
		<p>
			The Root Frequency (RF) is the number of time a root appeared among all compound characters in the while writing system.</p>
		<p>
			RF is different from the UF in that it reflects the essential feature of the whole writing system -- RF will not change unless writing system is changed. Whereas UF will vary depending the usage as well as the scope of contents or time period defined. RF reflects the designers thoughts of writing system. UF reflects the users thoughts of writing system.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>7. Greatest Common Factor (</strong>GCF)</p>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoint, all characters are relatively independent objects. Multiple object can be encapulated together to form a new object -- compound character. The new object can be encapsulated with other object to form another new object. For a paticular set of charaters, the smallest undividable object is called the root character.</p>
		<p>
			To find out the root characters or objects in TBI, the paper introduced a Greatest Common Factor(GCF)&nbsp;method -- a terminology borrowed from algebra -- which has tree steps:<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Find out the a set of characters that has the greatest in number with common factor or object among them.<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Take out the common object from each of character, leave the remained part to form a new set of objects.<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; From the new set of objects, repeat (1) and (2) until no more any common object could be found.<br />
			<br />
            As a sample, see <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Dian3_Book_Factoring_Analysis.htm">(Book GCF sample)</a>.
           
		<p>
			<br />
			From OOA viewpoint, the GCF is a reverse way for characters generatation process. The set of root characters of whole TBI was the we most essential part of TBI.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>8. Conclusions</strong></p>
		<p>
			The statistic analysis method the paper provided here looks easy and simple. But our study showed that these methods are powerful and played important roles in our TBI study.&nbsp; For example, through GCF method, more than 610,406 scattered unknown characters collected from Anyan site, that is close to the number of NIV OT <a href="./3.___00_Tbl_ChineseCharactersStatisticInNIV.htm">(NIVStatistic)</a>, can be reduced to become about one thousand root characters.</p>
