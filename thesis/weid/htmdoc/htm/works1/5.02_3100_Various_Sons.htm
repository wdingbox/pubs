			ZZ Phenomenon</h2>
		<p>
			(ZZ: ZuZi, 诸子, The Various Sons )</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Brief</strong></p>
		<p>
			The times around 400 BC was a very special for human history around the whole world --- many great thoughts or philosophies dramatically emerged like an explosion during that times.  <a href="./5.___01_Tbl-World-Influent-Persons.htm">(refer toWorld Influential Figures table )</a>. Since then until now for more than two thousands yesrs, no greater philosophies ever appeared, but gradually they were replaced with&nbsp; various &#39;great&#39; scientists with more and more low level material based discoveries, and eventually those scientists will be replaced by comercial techonologist and false prophacies. Especially in China, its history looks lik experienced a thought explosion.&nbsp; that is similar to species explosion (Cambrian explosion) in biological archeology.) No matter how advanced our science and tech are today, there is nothing new as comparied with their thoughts at that thimes. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			It was also around this period when there emerged what we called a special famous phenomenon of ZZ(abbreviated from ZuZi, 诸子,Various Sons) in China. The term ZZ(ZuZi) was first coined by SiMa-Qian(司马迁, 145-87 BC) from the phrase Zu-Zi-Bai-Jia ( 诸子百家, where Zu=various, Zi=Son, Bai=hundred, Jia=Family/school, academic branch) in&nbsp;his book 《史记&middot;屈原贾生列传》[_ShiJi]</p>
		<p>
			The ZZ was sometimes&nbsp;also commonly called&nbsp;先秦诸子(Various sons before the Qin Dynasty) and was widely quoted in Chinese legacy books. Since then, there were no any greater thoughts than those ever emerged in China history until today. However, Chinese historical books never explained what caused the ZZ phenomenon. To explore the root reasons and its motivation of the ZZ phenomenon evitably led us to an important discovery -- the prophecy literature that was ignored, hidden and lost in Chiese history.</p>

			<strong>ZZ Phenomenon</strong></p>
		<p>
			A newborn male offspring in Chinese denotes &#39;Zi&#39; (son). In order to know how a generic male baby name became widely used in adult male names in the ZZ period, we first need to explore its essential features of the ZZ phenomenon. Through our observation of history, we found that the ZZ phenomenon has the following three significant unique characteristics:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Large in Numbers</strong><br />
				<br />
				The numbers of times that the Chinese character &#39;Zi&#39; (Son) was used in the names or titles of a person was much higher than that in any other time in the whole of Chinese history. (See table: <a href="./5.___01_Tbl-ZuZi-BaiJia.htm">various Zi(Son) in China</a>) A typical example&nbsp;is the book of Chun-Qiu-Zuo-Zhuan (556-451 BC), which contained more than fifty people&#39;s names with Zi. (See table)<br />
				<br />
				Another example is Lun Yu 《论语》, which recorded the life and philosophical ideas of Kong-Zi and written by his followers after 473 BC. In this book, there were so many phrases of &quot;Son said&quot;(子曰) that the &#39;Zi&#39;(son) seemed almost as same as Kong, as if it were the pronoun of Kong-Zi (Confucious).<br />
				<br />
				Obviously, the&nbsp;numerous people with &#39;Zi&#39; (son) in their names during that time caused Sima-Qian to form the term ZZ(Various Sons). It was one of the significant differences that could distinguish itself from any other period in history.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Short in Time</strong><br />
				<br />
				<br />
				The ZZ phenomenon was so special in the chronicle calendar of China that it appeared just once and remained only for several hundreds of years which was a relatively short period compared to the several thousands of years in history.<br />
				<br />
				Before the ZZ period, for more than one thousand years, calling a person with the title of&nbsp;son (-zi) can be found in limited countable cases in historical books. For example, in ShangShu, we could find names like 胤子, 瞽子, 胄子(in ShangShu),&nbsp; the phrase 子曰 (in ZhouYi), and the title 君子(in Shijin), etc.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Right after the ZZ period, especially after the Han dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), the frequent usage of Zi in names dramatically reduced. During the following two thousand of years until today, the &#39;Zi&#39; (son) could hardly be found in names, although the new kings and great historical figures kept appearing in all dynasties. After the end of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of western style in the Republic of China in 1912 AD, the limited usage of &#39;Zi&#39;(son) in the titles for the ruling class were also fully abolished. For example, Tian-Zi(天子, Heavenly Son), the title for emperor, was now replaced by &#39;chairman&#39; or &#39;president&#39;.<br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Significant Influence </strong><br />
				<br />
				During that relative short ZZ time, although there existed many great persons in all areas, including medicine, astronomy, math, etc, only those with significantly influential phylosophical thoughts were recorded as Zi(son) in history. Among those, like Kong-zi, Meng-zi, Zhuang-zi, Lao-zi etc, we found that Kong-Zi was the most widely recognized figure who influenced Chinese culture.<br />
				<br />
				Similarly, in the ancient political system, only the high-ranked and powerful positions had the title with character of &#39;Zi&#39;(son). For example, in ancient books, they called the emperor as 天子(Heavenly Son), 元子(Original Son), 大子(Grand Son), and the offspring of emperor was called 王子(Kingdom Son), 太子(Highest Son), 公子(Majesty Son).<br />
				<br />
				Sometimes, the title for a respectful wise man also contains &#39;Zi&#39;(son). For example, we call a righteous person as 君子(Righteous Son), a knowledgeable and respectful person as 夫子(Master Son), etc. These titles were seldom used in mainland China after 1912. However, we can still find 夫子(Master Son) being used in NT with a Chinese-English union version.<br />
				<br />
				&#39;Zi&#39; was hardly used in names for a female, slave, or any other type of so-called low-ranked or none-influential persons in China history. Today, calling a person &#39;son&#39; in public has already become a kind of abusive language in China. Such tradition was somehow transmitted abroad into Japan -- the character Zi once was the reserved kanji for the Japanese imperial family and later became commonly used in Japanese female given names with -ko (子 &quot;child&quot;; e.g. &quot;Keiko&quot;) until today.<br />
				<br />
				In summary, the ZZ phenomenon showed that the density of usage of &#39;Zi&#39; (son) for a person&#39;s name reached its highest peak between the Spring-Autumn dynasty (春秋 770&ndash;476 BC) and the War Dynasty(戰國 476&ndash;221 BC). Obviously, it dropped to zero after the Han dynasty(206 BC-24 AD) and remained&nbsp; unchanged for more than two thousand years until today.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			There are about 120 English names with the suffix -son, like Addison, Emerson, Jackson, Thompson, Wilson etc. However, this case is complete different to the ZZ phenomenon because it does not have above features.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The ZZ phenomenon was not coincidental and isolated event in China&#39;s history. Chinese historians found that during the Shang Dynasty, many kings were named &#39;Zi&#39;(son). (See table: <a href="./5.___01_Tbl-ZuZi-BaiJia_Shang.htm">King&#39;s Names of Shang</a>)&nbsp; In bronze inscriptions, &#39;Zi&#39; (son), along with Fu(Father) and Ya(Cross), were the most frequently used characters during the Shang Dynasty. Some scholars also found that in the inscriptions of oracle bones, many records pointed to persons named &#39;Zi&#39; (son). [_WeiCiDe]</p>
		<p>
			In oracle bones, &#39;Zi&#39; has two forms. One is the pictogram derived from the picture of a manger, which is primarily used as the first item in the earth branch. Another one is the combination of &#39;cross&#39; and &#39;nail&#39; -- which means the newborn boy. Using the object-oriented analysis method, we can find that this &#39;Zi&#39; inherited the root character &#39;cross&#39; and hence contained all of its properties -- born from man (not female), friends of women (meaning good), etc.</p>
		<p>
			Using a biblical analysis method, we can perceive that, from the earliest two forms of characters &#39;Zi&#39;(son), to the connections between &#39;Zi&#39;(son) and the &#39;cross&#39;, to the frequent usage of &#39;Zi&#39; in bones and bronzes for inscriptions, to the names of kings in Shang, and to the ZZ phenomenon, there existed a clear continuous effort in more than one thousand years of Chinese history. This was from the prediction of the forthcoming &#39;Zi&#39;(son) presented through the creation of characters,&nbsp; to the waiting for the expected &#39;Zi&#39;(son) that presented from the tomb culture[_YaAndAsiaTombs] and to the recognition of the long expected &#39;Zi&#39; presented in ZZ phenomenon. It was this &#39;Zi&#39;(son) that had to be the king, the significant influence, the sage, a wise man,&nbsp; the purely perfect, the savior, the hope of all, and he had to come within the certain range of predicted time.</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, as we know from NT, such &#39;Zi&#39; (son) was not the person called Kong-Zi, even though he was wise and influential in Chinese history, nor the Men-Zi, Zhuang-Zi, and so on. The ancient Chinese sages seemed also to realize this. There were some evidences to show that they kept expanding their pursuing abroad during that time. One of those was the discovery of the Silk Road. Regretfully, this motivation was not noticed and recorded in the historical books, and is complete forgotten today.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			Obviously, the meaning of the Chinese character &#39;Zi&#39; what the ZZ phenomenon pointed to is far beyond the biological concept of a relationship between a male baby and his parents in our daily lives. Through writing and usage analysis, we can clearly discern that Zi represented a deep philosophical thought and religious belief that was closely related to &#39;father&#39;, &#39;son&#39;, &#39;cross&#39;, &#39;nail&#39;, &#39;heavenly&#39;, &#39;righteous&#39;, &#39;king&#39;, &#39;highest&#39;, &#39;original&#39;, &#39;manger&#39;, etc. All of these concepts can be well unified and perfectly match what the OT predicted and the Gospels clarified. The nature of the predictions, expectations and recognitions of what the ZZ phenomenon presented is accurately within the range of timelines predicted in the OT and before the NT. We can conclude that, although the Chinese ancient books contain many serious defects of missing, modifed, and fake books -- especially before the Qin Dynasty -- they also&nbsp;possess&nbsp;certain prophecy literature that is consistent with the OT. Regretfully, these elements were not always noticed throughout history.</p>
