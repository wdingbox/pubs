			EZ Method</h2>
		<p>
			EZ method, the abbreviation of Chinese pinyin of 二重证据法, Er-chong Zheng-ju (EZ) method, which can be translated into English as double evidence method, was first time mentioned in the book New Evidence in Archeology 《古史新证》published in 1925 by scholar Wang GuoWei 王国维[WangGuoWei].</p>
		<p>
			To face many uncertain issues in sinology study, Wang Guowei found that the materials in the existing documents (like the classic documents) and the materials unearthed under the ground (like turtle bones, bronzes, stones inscriptures) can support each others as evidences. Through comparitive analysis, the arugable documented materials can be verified or corrected by the unearthed materials, and vice versa.</p>
		<p>
			Before EZ method was widely accepted among Chinese scholars, a new theory, hypothesis or conclusion are usually mainly deducted through the large number of quotes that can be&nbsp;found in classic historic books,&nbsp; as well as the acceptable facts in common knowledge. Wheather a theory was correct or false was greatly affected by its environment of political systems.</p>
		<p>
			EZ method once had profound effect in Chinese archeology. It was the first time in histroy for Chinese scholars to begin to consider both materials as the scientifice evidences to solve problems and to present their opinions rather than using the social political potential powers or religious bias. &nbsp;It reduced large amount of unnecessary arguments inside the circle of Chinese archeological scholars, especially due to different ideaologies. One of well-known achievements made using the EZ method is the successful identification of Shang and Zhou dynasty through the consistency evidences between the inscriptions found in turtle bones or bronzes and the large amount of scattered statements found in the classic books[ZhangHaidan].</p>
		<p>
			However, since there exists large amount of defects in classical books, &nbsp;EZ method run into significant limitations. Hence, some scholars warns the usage of this method and proposed tripple or multiple Evidences methods, but its effects seems little[QiaoZhizhong].</p>
