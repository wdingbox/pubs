			Fu-Hao And Si-Mu-Wu</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			Chinese archeologists and scholars usually use the inscriptures on bronzes discovered on its site as primary hard evidences to identify the owner or the nature of its tomb -- even no soft evidences could be found. Typical examples of bronzes are the Fu-Hao at tomb site #5 and Si-Mu-Wu in royal grave garden. This methodology is not adquate for the tombs found in Anyang.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Fu-Hao</strong></p>
		See <a href="./5.__03_0000_FuHao_BronzeScriptures.htm">(*)</a>
		<p>
			The so-called Tomb of Fu-Hao (#5) was discovered in 1976 at temples areas of Anyang city. The excavation was officially conducted by the Anyang Working Team of the Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It is the only original archaeological site at Anyan areas without any destruction or robery. Among 1928 different unearthed materials (https://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/archae/2fuhmain.htm), there are 468 bronze objects, 209 of them contains inscriptions, 109 of them with inscriptons of &#39;Fu-Hao&#39;. Due this reason, the site was widely considered as the tomb for lady Fu-Hao -- a queen of King Wu Ding.</p>
		<p>
			However, some scholars questioned the nature of the excation site(#5). Zhang Sufeng etc. provided strong solid avidences to challenge the current conclusion[ZhangSufengBuShiXia].</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The site#5 was the only tomb in the worship temples areas. It was not inside of the rolyal graves garden.</li>
			<li>
				If we considter site #5 as a tomb, its rectangle structure was too simple as compared with other tombes in the graves garden.</li>
			<li>
				As the only well deseved tomb found in Yinxu, no formal coffin and body of owner was ever discovered. It is not like a tombs at all.</li>
			<li>
				Among 190 bronzes with inscriptions, there exist at least nine different inscriptions other than Fu-Hao. For example, like SiMuKui, YaQi etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The critical issue to interpret this picture lie in the confusion in meaning of character of &#39;Zhou&#39; 帚. Scholar Zhang Su Feng[ZhangSuFengAboutZhou] pointed out that &#39;Zhou&#39; looked like a reef and should be considered as a supersticous tree or a femal person in lagacy habitant -- which provided us a new way to think of it.</p>
		<p>
			By comparison, character &#39;Zhou&#39; in TBI can also be linked to the feather in Hieroglyphics -- not only they are similar in image alone, but also they have similar ways in friends making for compound words <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Zhou3_Friends.htm">(ZhouFreindsAnalysis)</a>.&nbsp; From its usage in writing system, we can find that the feather had special symblic meaning in its religion. This can further be confirmed in ancient persian&#39;s sculptures <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Zhou3_Img_As_Feather.htm">(FeathersInPersian)</a> about 700 BC;</p>
		<p>
			If we considering all inscription on the bronze as one picture, we can quicly find that among three foundmental different elements in it two of them (woman, son) could match the key figures of the story described in Gospel account. By applying BE analysis and visiual thinking methods, we can futher find the &#39;Zhou&#39; could be the star in heaven mentioned in Mathew 3:1-30.This assumption can be easily supported by visual comparion of the &#39;Zhou&#39; with the acient drawing about the comet <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Zhou3_Img_In_HistoryDoc.htm">(ImageOfZhouInHistory)</a>. In TBI, the friends of &#39;Zhou&#39; includes &#39;sun&#39;, &#39;rain&#39;, etc. that was related to the phenonmon of astronamy. See <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Zhou3_Friends.htm">(ZhouFreindsAnalysis)</a> Further friends analysis showed that all friends of &#39;Zhou&#39; has can directly or indirectly match the components of story in Gospel account.</p>
		<p>
			Whether we visually view the &#39;Zhou&#39; as a tree, a feather or a comet star is not really so important. The critical thing is what the symbols reprensent for -- the polymorphism feature in OOA. To interprect it as &#39;spirit&#39; is reasonable and acceptable.</p>
		<p>
			The original bronze inscriptions did not show any preferences for grouping among these root characters. All characters are organically combined together, they are equally dependent on each other, and encapsulated in one compund character, to represent one integrated picture, to inter one meaning for one purpose.&nbsp; To forcely split these characters into two groups as Fu-Hao is realy a reflection of the its people&#39;s thought for today -- a solid sample evidence of human devolution.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			From here we can clearly see that Fu-Hao in bronze was not meant to denote a name of a person or owner -- the woman, the son, the astromony symbolic feather as well as the cross, what all of that intented to info was exactly the same as what delivered in Gospel account.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. Si-Mu-Wu</strong></p>
		<p>
			<a href="./5.__03_0000_Si_Mu_Wu_Pictures.htm">picture</a>
            </p>
		<p>
			Si-Mu-Wu is the largest and heaviest bronze ware ever discovered in Chinese history. The tetripod is 133 centimetres high, 110 centimetres wide, and 79 centimetres deep and weighs 832.84 kilograms(1,925 pounds). It is of the rectangular type, with a squared body and four legs. It was unearthed in Wuguan Village, Anyang, Henan in 1939. Now it is stored in The National Museum of China in Beijing.</p>
		<p>
			Based on its inscription of Si-Mu-Wu(司母戊) that was found on the interior wall, this utensil was widely considered to be build for the monther &#39;Wu&#39;. Accordingly, the excavation site where this bonze was unearthed was considered as the tomb belonging to the same femal person -- the Queen, or the step-monter of the King.</p>
		<p>
			Since the 1970s there existed an augument between the interprestion of 司 and&nbsp; 后 among archaeologists and scholars. Finally The National Museum of China has officially changed the name of the bronze from 司 to 后. After 2011, Chinese TV began to use 后母戊 for broadcast in public. This led to the bronze has another meaning -- step-mother.</p>
		<p>
			As matter of fact, the augument between the Si and Hou is a misleading for all of us. There is no difference between Si and Hou in TBI. The original meaning of Si or Hou has already totally lost in history.</p>
		<p>
			If we consider all characters on the bronze as one single harmony integrated picture, it is not hard for us to clearly see that there is a woman, along with a cross and weapon in it. With BE anaylysis method, if we link the weapon as &#39;killing&#39; or macrasss, these three features can closely match the story accounted in Gospel.&nbsp; Futher with BE method, using visiual thinking, we can recongnized that Si as picture to represent a stable and manger.</p>
		<p>
			The soft evidence we can find in classic books, is the compound family name Si-Ma. The famous ancient historian&#39;s name Si-Ma-Qian(司马迁) is the well-known example.&nbsp; This compund name is still in use for today. It clearly tell us the Si and horse are closely related -- just like that the horse and stable are naturally always in one picture. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoints, Si is a compound character that composed of a manger <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Manger.htm">(ImageOfMangerInMegiddo)</a> and a building of shelter. With polymorphism, the character &#39;manger&#39; also looks like a mouth of baby to represent &#39;speaking&#39;. Throughout TBI, two characters are similar to &#39;manger&#39; -- Qi and Chi (teeth). We can consider them as the variation of manger. Visually Chi is more similar to mouth in image, but it was intentionally not used to represent the &#39;mouth&#39; or &#39;speak&#39; at all <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Mouth_Teeth.htm">(MouthAndTeeth)</a>. Because Chi could not visually represent the manger at the same time. It lost the OOA polymorphism feature, and became a pictorgraph to represent the limited meaning for &#39;teeth&#39;.</p>
		<a href="./5.__03_0000_TBI_Si1.htm">(*)</a>
		<div>
			<div>
				<br />
				<p>
					The character &#39;Qi&#39; looks like an open box or trough for horses or cattle to eat from, and with a&nbsp; &#39;cross&#39; to represent a &#39;child&#39; in it. Due to the reason that Qi could not represent &#39;mouth&#39;, Qi has limited meanings and limited friends. Its friend analysis could further help us to confirm that Qi represent a &#39;manger&#39; <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Qi2_Manger.htm">(Qi_Manger)</a>. Although we can trace back the writing of Qi through etymology and it was still in use mainly as a pronounce today, its original meaning of Qi was lost in history.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					<span class="st">The character (Chang 厂) that represent a building for the lodging and feeding of horses, cattle, etc. can be found in TBI, and it is still in use with meaning of factory today. </span>(厂: 马屋;牲口棚子). Its friends analysis can also comfirm this <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Chang3_Meaming.htm">(Chang_Manger)</a>. Chang also looks like Zhou (Comet) which specify the specialties of such stable.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				Although original meaning of Si has been totally lost, it has three variations Shi, Chen, Hou that can shed some lights for us.&nbsp; The survived meaning of shi (stone) could tell further that the manger is made of stone -- which is consistent to archeological discovery in Megiddo. The Chen was related to star, and used with women to represent &#39;pregnant&#39; which enhanced the specialties of the &#39;son&#39; demonstrated through GAP in TBI. Hou has meaning of &#39;king&#39;. All its variations words help us to restore the meaning of Si which is same as what the Gospel described about the stable and manger.</div>

					<strong>4. Synthesis Analysis</strong><br />
					<br />
					Although Fu-Hao and Si-Mu-Wu came from different bronzes and different archeological site with different periods at TBI times, with BE analysis method, we can find that they refer to a shared common meaning -- &#39;woman&#39;, &#39;cross&#39;, &#39;heaven&#39;, &#39;son&#39;</p>
				<p>
					The characters of &#39;stable&#39; and &#39;manger&#39;, &#39;women&#39;, &#39;comet&#39;, &#39;son&#39;, &#39;cross&#39; that we discussed here at TBI times can commonly found in bronzes in other sites and other period of times in history. To consider the characters on bronzes as names of the owners has brought confusions in archeological study. For example, in Fu-Hao tombe, there were bronzes with inscriptions of &#39;Ya-Qi&#39;, &#39;Si-Mu&#39; etc.</p>
				<p>
					Throughout all unearthed materials at Anyang, no personal glorified idols were found. If the person, no matter who he was a king or queen, were not the center of worship, then the person&#39;s name was not necessary needed to be specially recorded.</p>
				<p>
					The BBO phenonmen also told us that the characters at TBI times were considered as sacred same as the bronzes. Characters were only used for worship purpose. So characters were less likely to be used for worshippers.</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					From OOA viewpoints, we can find the TBI&nbsp; characters were the products of high intelligent one time design. At the time when TBI characters were envented, there were no any neccessariy that pronounciations be asscociated with them. Since the TBI writing system is totally independant to its pronouciation.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					From the advanced technologies we could find at Anyang, we can conclude that there must already exist a matural oral language system before TBI. The Chines oral lanuages system was harder to trace and study than writing system. For long time in history, the orale languages and writing system were two different things. At one hand, in different areas, the dialects are quite different, and differences were kept until today. On the other hand, the way that people spoke in daily life was quite different to the classical books recorded. The integration between spoken language and writen languages only started until early twenty century during PaiHuaWen movement.</p>
				<p>
					People at TBI times might have names in oral language system, but they did not have names with writble characters associated with them in writing system, since each characters in TBI might not have pronounceation associated with them. The characters did not belong to the specific persons. The persons that the characters demonstrated pictorgraphically did not refer to the real existing one among them.&nbsp;To use inscriptions to determine the owner of the materials or tomb is incorrect.</p>
				<p>
					In another words,The TBI writing system can exist in anywhere in any coulture, in any oral languages system as long as people understand its believes. TBI system is only dependant to the thougths or beliefs what was revealed.</p>
				<p>
					Even with advanced communication techonolgies of today, the complete different dialats systems exists over the china in different areas. This situation will be extended to different places all over the world once people understand the TBI.</p>
				<p>
					Obviously these characters found on braonzes are not used to denote the person&#39;s name but to present as a single picture to express their devout deep religious thoughts and hearts to the loved one that was high in heaven and was about to come.</p>
				<p>
					Although the combination of characters found on different bronzes may different, with BE anaylsys method, we can find that there existed a common topic, a common sense -- they all pointed to a same story that is consistent to what the Gospel stated.</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					<strong>5. Broze Inscription (BI) Analysis</strong></p>
				<p>
					Collecting all Bronzes Inscriptions (BI), we can find that there about only 300 different characters used on bronzes. By applying usage frequency (UF) statistic method, we can turn out that the top three most frequently used characters are &#39;Fu&#39; (father), &#39;Y&#39; (cross), and &#39;Zhen&#39; (son).&nbsp; &#39;Fu&#39;, &#39;Hao&#39;, &#39;Si&#39; we disscussed are among the top 30 characters.</p>
				<p>
					If we compare BI UF with TBI RF, we can find that they are significaly close in Zipf&#39;s curve line. Compared with&nbsp; unearthed materials of TBI that most of them were broken into pieces, BI perfectly preserved the whole contents of BI characters although the total number of characters we found were less than TBI.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					<strong>6. Conclusion</strong></p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			The inscriptions on bronzes discovered at Anyang were not the records indicating the name of the people. All characters are organically combined together. They are equally dependent on each other. They are encapsulated in one integrated picture to inter one meaning for one purpose which is same as what the messages the Gospel dilivered.<br />
