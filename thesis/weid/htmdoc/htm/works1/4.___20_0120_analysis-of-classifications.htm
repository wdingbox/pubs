			Analysis Of Classifications In TBI</h2>
		<p>
			The classification we used here in picotograms is designed based on the common modern knowledge in our daily life. It is also&nbsp;deeply affected by&nbsp;the materialism that believe that the survive or exitsting of animal is determined by the perfect fit betweeinits capbilties and its living enviroment.</p>
		<p>
			The first foundmental material that people can survive is the food. The sun and&nbsp;air&nbsp;are so aboundant that human can enjoy it without&nbsp;doing anything. &nbsp;The daily required food however is not garanttted 7x24. It is also not as easy as air to get it whenever they need them. The fresh food is aboundant in natural&nbsp;in autum but not&nbsp;in winter. Human have to have a plan and work&nbsp;for food no matter thru the agriculture or livestock to maintain the life.&nbsp;People can choose a place with aboundatnt water and comfortable climate to ease their work and live. But so far we can not find any evidence that early human being have&nbsp;any capabilities or strong desire to choose to developt hybernating technique to maintain their life and survive.</p>
		<p>
			The clothes and housing are the second foundmental materials for the people who lived in Yinxu (Longitude: 112.1872, Latitude: 37.8997, similar to New York in latitude)&nbsp;where the tempeature could reach to as low as -5 Centidegree.&nbsp;A person in regular clothing immersed in water just above freezing will last only a few minutes. Being in cold temperature air with proper shelter and clothing, humans can survive indefinatley, even if the temperature is below zero degrees, but it would be a bitter and painful&nbsp;life.</p>
		<p>
			Based on the knowledge of modern science and tech, it is natural for us to think that the food, clothes and housing should be the center activities and works&nbsp;for human&nbsp;in order to maintain to live generation by gneration. However, from the freqencies of word and complixities of synonums of words in OBI tree, it show that&nbsp;what the they most concerned were&nbsp; about the worship and war,&nbsp;we call it WW phenomenia. The WW phenomena told&nbsp;us that the threaten of life is not about the shortage of food, lack of clothes or housing, or earthquake, drownage, the wild animals, or the airbone illness, etc. The threaten of life&nbsp;came from human himself. The weapon are not primily used for hunting, but used for defencing and offencing. The vessals are not primirily used for&nbsp;daily&nbsp;food, but used for worship GOD.&nbsp;</p>

			1) Weapons</p>
		<p>
			There were about 60 synonyms about the weapons. Some chinese tried to&nbsp;classify them into 18 different types. Indeed, they are much more complicated than that. Many of them are still in use today. One of&nbsp;them&nbsp;is&nbsp;the word of&nbsp;pronoun &#39;me&#39; or &#39;I&#39; in English. see table. No evidence was found that the weapons unearthed in Yinxu&nbsp;were used for large scale military&nbsp;war in&nbsp;battle ground.&nbsp;The facts that words inscriped on the weapon&nbsp;and the fact that weapons are unearthed along with vessols, and turtle bones and other worship site not the battle fields, prove that weapon were treated as part of instruments for&nbsp;worship. In concreat&nbsp;it&nbsp;was used&nbsp;a symbol of&nbsp;the power, authority, sovenrige that other worship instruments did not have.&nbsp;</p>

			2) Worship-vessals</p>
		<p>
			There are about 60 different words used to present the vessals used for worship. Among them, ZHEN is the morst frequently used word.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			There are some commons between weapons and worship-vessals.</p>
		<p>
			- Both weapons and worship-vessals are heavey industry products made of valueable&nbsp;bronzes.</p>
		<p>
			-Both weapons and worship-vessals have many different kinds types. Many scholars tried to classify the weapons and worship-vessales. But except for making it easies to remember, there is not different among different types.</p>
		<p>
			- The weapons were not actually used as tools for fighting in battle field. The vessals are not used for human cooking or kichen utilities. Weaspons and vessals are found together used for worship.&nbsp; We can found in worship ritual, weapon represent the power, unyieldable soveignty, herotics, mighty, divine. Vessals represent the obdience, giving to god.</p>

			中国的一项最新调查显示，据统计，殷墟自一九二八年开始考古发掘以来，出土甲骨约十五万片，青铜器六千件左右，玉器二千六百多件，加上石器、骨器、竹木器、漆器、皮革制品、纺织品等，重要及完整的文物至少有数十万件。</p>

			&nbsp;中国古代的青铜文化十分发达，并以制作精良，气魄雄伟、技术高超而著称于世。 奴隶主把青铜器作为宴享和放在宗庙里祭祀祖先的礼器。 青铜器不是一般人可以拥有的，它作为一种权利和地位的象征、一种记事耀功的礼器而流传于世，并非使用品。<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			青铜器铭文的字体主要为篆书，多铸刻在青铜器的内底、盖内。铭文始见于商代早期，商代中晚期逐步增多，但文字均较短，最短者仅一二字，最长者也不超过50字。内容大多较为简单，主要为所有者的族名、祭祀对象、作器者名、用途等。但已经具备结构、章法和用笔这三个构成书法艺术的要素。<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			妇好墓中出土的青铜礼器中有将近二百件有铭文，其中妇好和单一的&ldquo;好&rdquo;字一百件左右，根据同时期的甲骨卜辞推断，此墓的主人就是商王武丁的配偶&ldquo;妇好&rdquo;，其人虽为女性，但却是带兵征伐之将帅，不是考古证据即在眼前，实在觉得不可思议。</p>

			&nbsp;几十年前安阳科考队发掘殷墟最初的目的为了获得甲骨，随着科考的深入，考古大家以为不应该局限于小屯一地，同时还应该探寻更多其他类型的殷商文化遗址，最终以<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">梁思永</span>为首的考察队在西北冈一带发现了若干大型墓葬，这些墓葬体量巨大，往往有四条墓道，虽经过反复盗掘，可墓葬区的遗物还是超乎想象的丰富，由此有理由断定，这些大墓是为商王的陵墓，这一发现当年极为轰动，不用说国内知名的学者纷至沓来，连法国汉学家<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">伯希和</span>也专程至此一探究竟，安阳的考古发掘，是由中国学者和中国学术机关第一次自发自主的考古工作，而第一次即有这样的成就，是之前谁都没有料到的，在苦难艰辛的时代，这实在是一种激发国民自尊自信的强心剂，难怪几十年后，已入耄耋之年亲历者回忆起来，激动之情还是那样溢于言表。</p>
