			<strong>Silk-Road and Magi</strong></p>
		<p>
			<br />
			<strong>1. Silk-Road</strong></p>
		<p>
			The term Silk-Road was first discovered and coined by Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen (5 May 1833 &ndash; 6 October 1905, a German traveller, geographer, and scientist)&nbsp; in his book (China: The results of my travels and the studies based thereon, 1877&ndash;1912, 5 vols. and atlas). Its bussiness routine distance is about 4,000 miles (6,437 kilometres) crossing today&#39;s terretian from China Xinjiang, Tajikistan, afgpanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Turky.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			China was the earliest country to raise silkworms and produce silk; the first archeological evidence of the silk trade is the finding of silk in the hair of an Egyptian mummy of the 21st dynasty, c.1070 BC.[<a href="#1">1</a>]. On the other hand, Chinese earliest characters in Shang contained many symbols similar to Egyptian heiroglyphics[Lubec_Holaubek_Feldl_Strouhal]. Shiji contained many astronomy terms from foriegn using phonetic similarity method (3).<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>To West Not East</strong><br />
			Contrast to south-east China, the green plain, &nbsp;the tributary of the Huang He River and south of the Yangzi River delta, the territal of west China is comprised of mountains and deserts as well as plateaus with sever weathers that do not provide much arable land for agriculture and living. Besides, the west of China was alway under the threat of the attack from the nomadic peoples (sometime referred to as &quot;barbarians&quot;, or Xiongnu). In spite of those negtive reasons, Chinese ancient still prefer west to east. None of ancient city was found along the east coast. They all built along the west foot of mountain.&nbsp; the traffic activities of on the Silk-Road was never stopped or blocked in ancient China.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Story of ZhangQian</strong><br />
			The earliest writen records related to the Silk-Road can be found in 《史记&middot;大宛列传》 by SiMa-Qian. The book described that the Han emperor(about 140 BC) was interested in establishing commercial ties with far west distant lands of China, but we could not find detailed explaination of such motivations.&nbsp; The author particully mentioned a person called Zhang Qian who was sent to west for twices. In his first trip, he was captured by the hostile Xiongnu, but he was not killed; he escaped and returned back after about 10 years. The second trip took him about 2 years and died a year later right after was back. Besides the text message that&nbsp;showed us that the life of journey to west was hard, it also conatined&nbsp;interesting informations useful&nbsp;to our TBI study:<br />

		<ol>
			<li>
				畫革旁行以為書記<br />
				<br />
				Plain Chinese: 画革：在皮革上划记号。旁行：横行（ｈ&aacute;ｎｇ，航）。书记：文字。<br />
				English: The book is made of horizontal handwriting on skins of animals.<br />
				<br />
				Analysis:<br />
				(1) Contrast to chinese viertical writing from up to down, at&nbsp;that time,&nbsp;ancient Hebrews writing was a horizontal way from right to left.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
				(2) While Chinese used&nbsp;the bamboo or silk at that time, anceint hebrew used parchment for handwriting.<br />
				It is possible that these refer to some&nbsp;Hewbrews books.</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				其人皆深眼，多須珣，善市賈，爭分銖。俗貴女子，女子所言而丈夫乃決正。<br />
				<br />
				Plain Chinese: 那里的人都眼睛凹陷，胡须很重，善于做买卖，连一分一铢都要争执。当地风俗尊重女人，女子说话，丈夫就坚决照办而不敢违背。&rdquo;<br />
				English: People there are deep eyes, strong beard, good at trading; bargin even for one cent; repect female; husband obey;<br />
				<br />
				Analysis:<br />
				(1) The deep eyes and strong beard can easily match the&nbsp;properties of Jewish people.<br />
				(2) Being good at trade and bargining for even 1 cent&nbsp;was typically the charateristics of Jewish people.<br />
				(3)&nbsp;As compared with ancient China, Hebrews women has more right in ancient.<br />
				Hence, it is possible that those people mentioned are Hebrews. Chinese historic book Shiji contains large mount of phrases translated from foriegn languages.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				初，天子發書易，雲「神馬當從西北來」。&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				Plain Chinese: 最初，天子翻开《易经》占卜，书上写道：&ldquo;神马当从西北来。&rdquo;<br />
				English: In the begining, emperor open superstitious book of Yi, it said: godly horse shall come from north-west.<br />
				<br />
				Analysis:<br />
				(1) In Chinese historic books, TBI and Yi were considered as superstations. But superstions could be the corrupted prophacies.<br />
				(2) &quot;godly horse&quot; could mean something special. &quot;come from north-west&quot; showed the directins of location.<br />
				(3) If emperor knew and believe such superstation, then&nbsp;it means it was important.<br />
				The&nbsp;superstations or prophacy&nbsp;could be the motivation for emperor or wiseman to keep sending people to travel to west in spite of the extreme difficulties and dangers.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Item (1) and (2) were informations&nbsp;passed by ZhangQian after his return from the journey to west. It can help us to suggest that ancient Chiese people was interested in the foreign people, possibly the Hebrews far west of China land.&nbsp; Item (3) suggests that there ever&nbsp;existed some ancient Chinese wisemen or prophcies&nbsp;who already knew&nbsp;that the land that is far away to west of China was the&nbsp;places that something special could happen.</p>
		<p>
			Hence, we can conclude that there existed exciting motivation to drive them to adventure to west regions although it&nbsp;could take one or two years and&nbsp;face difficulties and threatens, and to travel to ancient cannan areas from far east China at that time was completely possible although such journey was never mentioned in other Chinese historic books. In spite that&nbsp;we still knew little&nbsp;about the civilization&nbsp;along the the Silk-Road, at least, it showed that Chinese civilization had preferences to west direction espcieally during Han Dynasty.</p>

			<strong>2. Story of Magi</strong></p>
		<p>
			Magis were mysterious visitors mentioned only in the chapter of Methew 2:1-12&nbsp; in NT. Today we know little about them. Some scholars proposed that the ancient Magi were a hereditary priesthood of the Medes (known today as the Kurds), but recent scholar Brent Landau, based on his study of an apocryphal account from Syriac manuscript written as early as the mid-second century, preserved in an eighth-century&nbsp;and&nbsp;now held in the Vatican Library, &nbsp;proposed that they were the ancient Chinese sages. At least there are three features described in NT can support this hyposes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Magi came from east<br />
				China is the only country that located the most east area of Asia continent. Its popluation, territery coverage&nbsp;and consitent culture affection were large enough to represent the east of its whole continent at all times.</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				Magi knew Astrology<br />
				Astrology, the Book of Yi 易经,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;TBI,&nbsp;were mentioned as a way of superstation many times in Chinese historic books and was kept with the same attitude until today. The superstation was the misuse of prophecy,&nbsp;part of sympotom of human devolution.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Magi carried gold, incense and myrrh.<br />
				The myrrh&nbsp;was a well-known herb from plant that was still in use until today; The burning frankincense could be used both for desease healing and for religious rituals in China; The gold in ancient china was not used for monetary exhange or decoration but pimarily used as mineral medicines. [<a href="#2">2</a>]&nbsp; For example, the earliest drinkable gold drug developed by alchemists was first mentioned in books &quot;on salt and iron&quot; 盐铁论 written as early as 81 BC.&nbsp; That all three different precious gifts were served as one purpose -- elixir immortals, could be one of most important keys to distinguish between Chinese and any others at ancient time.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Although the evidences to support that Magi were Chinese were still weak, we could not find strong evidence to deny such proposal. Relatively speaking, it seems that the supporting evidence is stronger than objecting evidences. At least more or less, the topic of text about magi was toward the east direction.<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. Summary</strong></p>
		<p>
			Although the geographical distances between the two stories of the silk-road and magi are about four thousands of miles and full of curves and mysteries, they happened relatively in a close time range within maximium of two hundreds of years. Although they looks like so irrelevent, for TBI study, they provide the feasibility, possibility and insight of how ancient Chinese made their efforts, satisfied their believed unspeakable expections, and how Chinese characters in TBI could fulfill their predictions so accurately both in time and space and passed down to us until today, even though their descents had lost them.</p>
