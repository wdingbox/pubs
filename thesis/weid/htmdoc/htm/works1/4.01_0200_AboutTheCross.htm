			About Chinese Cross Character (CCC)</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Introduction </strong></p>
		<p>
			For more than two thousands of years in China, both oral legends and literal books consider the CCC, &quot;十&quot;, as a numeric number &#39;ten&#39;. [ShuoWenShi] It was widely used in the calendars for months, and commonly compared to a hundred or a thousand, etc. It was not until the discovery of OBI that we could finally find out that it was wrong -- the very original meaning of CCC was indeed to denote the number &#39;seven&#39;. It was the biggest and most significant error that ever had in writing languages in China. It was also the astonishing falsification in the world for whole human history.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. The Restoration of the Original Meaning of CCC</strong></p>
		<p>
			In TBI, the CCC was the most confusing, complicated but most influential root character. It has two different meanings in two different systems in two earliest documents[TheFED].</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				denote &#39;seven&#39; in Numeration system (document N).</li>
			<li>
				denote &#39;first&#39; in Heaven-stems (document H).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The Chinese etymology clearly showed us how the CCC was gradually misrepresented from the position in seventh to tenth in Nu document since the OBI times. (see following table) The distortion started with the unnoticeable changes of characters, made the original character &#39;ten&#39; more and more look like the original seven, and fostered the original seven to become a new character, eventually the original ten was replaced by the original seven. The Nu document was successfully modified by moving the CCC from its seventh position to tenth position. The whole process silently took about nearly one thousand years right before all characters were sealed. It looks like a long-term political conspiracy.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__01_0200_N-H-Doc_Modifications.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			Except the first three characters in document N, all characters were modified more or less both in writing and meanings. [OldestChineseCharacters] Whereas, the changes of the position of CCC in document N was the boldest and most severe falsification among all changes in writing system in history. (See [TheFED])<br />
			<br />
			The CCC was one of the several most important root characters to form the whole writing system. The completion of the modification of document N not only damaged the original spirits of the book, changed the original meaning of the CCC, but also ultimately corrupted the whole writing system. Since then, a perfect well-designed writing system became an inferior one. We can clearly see that the documents defects started with the earliest document N. The falsification and the Chinese culture were not dividable.&nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			The restoration of the position of CCC in document N is the starting point to restore its original meanings in TBI. It is also the entry point to understanding the origination of Chinese writing system and its developments and roles in culture, thoughts and beliefs.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. The CCC and the Document N</strong></p>
		<p>
			To restore the meaning of the CCC, the BE method is the best one that we could find so far.&nbsp; By comparison between the N and the Genesis, along with statistic techniques, we can find many similar consistent orders, events as well as corresponding matches between the visual images demonstrated from characters and the story or ideas described in cannonial books.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__01_0200_N-H-Doc_Comparison_Bible.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Perceptually, the document N can be devided into two parts, the first four characters, due to its self-clone in population, cause the obsevers to pursue the logic and reationality through the linear or sequential analysis, the simple pattern found in the simplest structure required the least tensions of eyes as in sleeping state.</p>
		<p>
			As a contrast, the remained parts in Nu, has no any patterns, but full of puzzles with complexity, that perplex lead observers to keep blinking and stressing eyes to explore the mysterious in a new environment. The successful visual pleasure gained from the first part could be the driven power to keep the brain thinking until to get the ultimate satisfying anwers.</p>
		<p>
			The differetiation of two parts in the eyes movement from the visual psychologic effects can perfectly match the creation process -- no any kind of eyes exist in the world until the fifth day when the birds fly in sky, the fish swiming in water under the sunshine stated in stories of Genesis. In TBI, there is no differences for eyes between human and animals. It was the experiences of the eyes movement that manifest the features of creation process. From this viewpoint, the number of the first part had to be four, no more or less, in comprehensive compositional order. The discontinued logic, the sudden appearance of the most baffled and complicated character &#39;five&#39;, intensify such purpose through the visual psychologic effects.</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, the character of &#39;four&#39; in N was modified by its users early in history. (See table above) The motivation could be psychologic. Although the mathematical functionalities were not affected, the modification undermined the intentions for the connection bewteen the Nu and Genesis -- an evidence of wrting devolution.</p>
		<p>
			Among six thousand different characters in TBI, only first three character in document N, its writing and the basic numeration meaning, were fully kept and used until today.&nbsp; All other characters were change in writing , meaning or both. The CCC was a typical sample that the writing was remained, but meaning was fully changed[OldestCharactersList].</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		See <a href="./4.__01_0200_Predicted_Church_InTBI.htm">(*)</a>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			We could not find direct relationship between Genesis and document N for characters at 6th and 7th position. (See table item 6,7) However, we can find that &#39;six&#39; and &#39;seven&#39; have close friendship relationship (See above table).&nbsp; Among ten different characters in N, only 6 and 7 have many paired characters in TBI. Apparently, all of above characters are very similar to the pictures of the churches for today. They also could the images of the temples they built at Anyang at OBI times.</p>
		<p>
			There are about 240 different characetrs in OBI made of &#39;six&#39;. RF analysis show that the best root friend for the &#39;six&#39; was the nailed-cross-hand. When &#39;six&#39; being with double hands <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_House_and_Hands.htm">(DoubleHandsHouse)</a> -- highly raised, it means it is the sacred. Through the compound character composed of &#39;six&#39; and &#39;nine&#39; [SixAndNine], that is still in use for today, and means the great, we can conclude that the &#39;house&#39; also have the meaning of &#39;manger&#39;, and &#39;nine&#39; could mean &#39;son&#39;. In many ways, all of these characters abstracted not only the pictures, but also the concept of the churches for today. <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_House_and_Church_Today.htm">(HouseLikeChurch)</a> Unfortunately, few of them, for example, Zhai 宅 (big house), Hong (great),etc. were still in use for today, most of others were lost in history.<br />
			<br />
			In classical book Dao De Jing, it mentioned a phrase of six-relataives[SixRelatives].&nbsp; For long time in Chinese history, there was no consensus about what types of six of different relativities they are. Through our analysis, we can find that if we consider the six that looks like a house as the created people in the house rather the number. then there was no any confusion about the phrase.</p>
		<p>
			Besides, through RF analysis, the CCC has a best friend -- woman. The woman has the best friend of the &#39;son&#39;. The cirluar relationship among the CCC, woman and son mirrored the connection relationship between the CCC and Gospel. It was through the story of Gospel, we can finally find the connection between the CCC and the seventh blessed holy day in Genesis. Accordingly, we can find the connection between the &#39;six&#39; and the story of Adam and Eve through the picture of a house or manger that was prepared for man and woman.</p>
		<p>
			From here, the relationship between &#39;one&#39; and the CCC became easy to further understand. With OOA, the CCC is a child character derived through the combination of &#39;one&#39; and &#39;ten&#39;. The CCC was made of &#39;one&#39; and &#39;ten&#39;. It came from &#39;one&#39;, and at the same time it was at the begining with &#39;one&#39;. It can be the explaination for the unknown compound character[OneAndSeven] -- a character that helped for comprehensive reading for the CCC. (refer to John 8:58, 14-6)</p>
		<p>
			For the last three character in Nu, the flood, the snake that also represent the son of man, and the last one in number, they can perfectly match the three most important events after the creation, respectively -- the flood that had passed, the born of son of man in manger -- the forthcoming good news, and the end of the world in future.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The CCC was also the first character in H. Along with the first character &#39;son&#39; in E, it also was in the first phase in S -- that falled into 4 AD in Gregoria calendar when repeatedly used for year counting.  <a href="./5.___06_Tbl_system-60-years-Gregorian.htm">(*)</a> All of these could further enrich the original concept and meaning for the CCC and made it more mystierios than we ordinarly knowledge of seven.</p>
		<p>
			The meadning of the CCC in docuement N, H and S, as well as the relationship between N and OT/NT, suggested that the CCC has a third meaning same as the symbol in Gospel.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. Friends Of&nbsp; the CCC</strong></p>
		<p>
			From the restoration of the CCC, we can conclude that the CCC in&nbsp;TBI had three different meanings:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				SEVERN in the document N.</li>
			<li>
				FIRST in the document H</li>
			<li>
				Cross in Gospels of NT.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			There are about 100 different complicated compound characters contains the CCC in TBI. For simplicity in discussion, we selected all about 35 characters with easy identiable objects for the CCC, and put them in 18 different groups. See  <a href="./4.___00_Tbl-FriendsOfCross_typical.htm">CCC Friends Table</a>. Among the list, we found that only five characters were still in use for today. All other characters were lost in history.</p>
		<p>
			Using three different meanings of the CCC to try to decodes all its compound characters in the table, we can find that, only the third meanings of the CCC related to Gospels can consistently and perfectly explain all of them. The freinds relationship of the CCC in compound characters can make super natural senses for Gospels.</p>
		<p>
			For characters that were still in use, its current meanings did not conflict to the ideology of Gospels. On the contary, it help us to restore the original meaning. For example, the 宅(Zhai) currently denotes mension or big house. But originally it refer to the template for worship. When Chinese people did not not worship anymore, the character Zhai became the private big laxuary house.</p>
		<p>
			Without the references of neightor characters or contents information, it is hard to distinguish which meaning it actually presented for the CCC between N and H. Indeed, as the root character with mathmatic numeric meanings, both seven in N and first in H could not make sense in its compound characters. The confusion between the seven and fisrt for CCC could be one of the driving forces to eventually modify the CCC in history.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. The Children Of CCC</strong></p>
		<p>
			The restoration of CCC could help us to better apply OOA method to find out all the lost children of CCC in order to restore the meaning of them. All children were generated through variation and aggregation. For simplicity of disscussion, they can be classified into three groups:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Decorated Cross<br />
				See <a href="./4.__01_0200_Decorated_Cross_InTBI.htm">(*)</a>.
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				X-shaped Cross<br />
				See <a href="./4.__01_0200_X-Shape_Cross_InTBI.htm">(*)</a>
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Nailed Cross (refer to <a href="./4.___01_0300_WhoIsOnCross.htm">pictures</a>)<br />
				See <a href="./4.__01_0200_Nailed_Cross_InTBI.htm">(*)</a>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Total children of CCC was about 60. The CCC along with his polymorphic sons and grandsons, tooks the majority part of all logogram roots, played the most important role for all compund characters.&nbsp; The CROSS&#39;s family is not only the biggest family in logographics system, but also is the&nbsp;kernel in thoughts&nbsp;of whole writing system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			However, almost all children of the CCC and their compound characters made from them were lost and never used in Chinese history. Whereas, all typles of CCC were widely used in western and other areas of the world. (<a href="../">see table</a>) Among limited survived children of CCC, the most confused but long time used charcter in history was the &#39;son&#39;.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>6. Macro and Micro of CCC</strong></p>
		<p>
			If we view the tbi from the angle of macro structure, we can find that the cross structure are the foundimental infrastructure of chinese words. People can typically feel this during chinese writing process.&nbsp;All words&nbsp;must be&nbsp;drawn inside&nbsp;of a&nbsp;squre, weighed in the center,&nbsp;balanced under&nbsp;the grid of cross. This foundimental structural characteristic produce the asethics.</p>
		<p>
			<a href="./4.__01_0200_MacroMicriCrossInTBI.htm">(*)</a> </p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;If we view the tbi from the point of micro structure, we can find that virutally almost all tbi are directly or indirectly, obviously or inobviously made of the cross. The cross exist both in micro and macro structure of tbi. We call it the cross characterisic of tbi.</p>
		<p>
			Although most of the words have been lost or changed during&nbsp;more thatn three thousands, the underlying micro and macro cross characterisic never ever changed.&nbsp;It is this&nbsp;feature&nbsp;that distingush from himself to Japanese, Korea that derived from china and&nbsp;any other languages in the world.</p>
		<p>
			This characteristics of cross of chinese words can be easily&nbsp;demonstrated when we read the introduction of gildon&#39;s bible, where many different languages are used to tranlate the John 3-16.&nbsp;You may&nbsp;not speak chinese at all, but you can distinguish it from other languages by counting the&nbsp;large number of micro structure of cross in the writings.&nbsp;In contrast, you could hardly pick out cross from other languages translated from John3-16.</p>
		<p>
			This cross characteristic of tbi or chinese provide another evidence that tbi word has relationship with bible.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>7. Conclusion </strong></p>
		<p>
			The resotation of the CCC, the discoveries of the connections between the Nu and OT, typically in Genesis, the connections between Nu and NT, typically in Gospels, as well as the the theological connections among them, clearly showed us that there existed large amount of predictive messages among the earliest Chinese characters -- just like the one that OT had. More similar evidences could be found, for example, character Zi (son). All evidences showd that the very original Chinese characters belong to the prophecy literature.</p>
		<p>
			Chinese writing system is independant to the Chinese oral launguages system. The initial invented characters was not part of matured oral language system at all. The high intelligent complicated writing engineering system was mainly created and maintained by another already existed oral system in history. The modification <span data-dobid="hdw">of characters were caused by misrepresention in oral system due to the changes of their thoughts generation by generation. </span>The changes of the Chinese writing system reflected the changes of the thoughts and the beliefs of the people in history.</p>
		<p>
			For example, there was no seven based system in Chinese calendars as in Jewish calendar or any other habitant traditions remained until today in Chinese history. The meaning of seven from Genesis could be lost as early as the OBI times. Chinese had a strong 10 and 12 based system traditions. To modify the &#39;seven&#39; and change the &#39;seven&#39; to &#39;ten&#39; was inevitable.</p>
		<p>
			These changes are also the strong evidences that the OBI system was not evolved from the simple meaningless scratches to a complicated writing system during the working practices of the hundreds of years at the OBI times, or long time before the OBI times. The more changes a character had, the less connection to the biblical account we could find, the more difficult for us to understand. We can clearly see that through the long history the Chinese writing system is a process from the perfect to the inferior -- it was nearly perished to be replaced with western Latinos during early twenty century, from the easiest to the most difficult to learn in the world -- today if you want to learn the chinese writing, you have to learn the redundant both simplified and traditional two different sets of characters at the same time, regardless the dozens of different dialects in speaking.</p>
		<p>
			The motivation to change characters could be many -- from academics to politics, to ideologies etc. from the disabey of the traditions to the desires of revolution or reforms, or the struggling among different groups with different ideologies etc. The Chinese etymology shed some light about the waired character wars ever happend in history. The only three characters remained unchanged both in writing and meanings[OldestCharactersList], the distorted little cross symbole remained in the simplified character of &#39;seven&#39;, etc. could show the efforts, or even with bloody or life, made or contributed to reserve the original as much as possible.&nbsp;In general, the <span data-dobid="hdw">distortion </span>of the earliest characters exposed us a foundimental fact -- the original theological predictive meaning among the earliest characters could not be fully understood by its offsprings. Hence, the initial purposes of the invention of OBI gradually was tempered with the all kinds of desires from the users of descendants. Eeventually the prophacy characters were turned into the superstitius practices -- the oracle bones inscriptions -- the results of human falling.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			With BE method, the original meaning of the CCC was restored -- it was far byond the mathematic meaning of &#39;seven&#39;. The changes of the CCC in history reflect the falling of Chinese writing system, as well as the human beings.</p>
		<p>
			&#39;So the &#39;ten&#39; contains the meaning of &#39;one&#39;, which is helpful to understand the meaning of John 8:58(NIV John 8:58).&nbsp; If we could understand the meaning of &#39;one&#39;, then it is not hard for us to perceive that the vertical line in the cross represented a road connected between the heaven and the earth (John 14:6(NIV John 14:6)).</p>
