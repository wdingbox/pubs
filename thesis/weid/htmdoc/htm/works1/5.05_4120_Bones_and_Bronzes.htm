			The Earliest Book From Bones and Bronzes</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Instrduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			For the first time, this paper proclaimed that it had found the earliest four books or documents that was long time neglected in Chinese history, which was the foundation and starting point of whole Chinese literatures, even earlier than TBI/BI. This discovery brought TBI study into a new era.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Bones and Bronze Only (BBO) </strong></p>
		<p>
			Bronze and turtle bones are two completely different materials -- one is the biological organic bones and one is the casted compound metal.&nbsp; But all earliest characters were only found writen on these bones or bronzes. We called this as BBO phenonmenons in Chinese earliest writing system.</p>
		<p>
			Since discovered in 1899, the estimated about 400,000 pieces of bones have been discovered and colloected from the small area at Anyang. Large amount of demands of turtle bones would definately made it expansive at TBI times. Many turtle bones were found not locally but transported from far away even in south sea. <a href="./5.___05_Tbl-Spices-of-Turtle-ShellsInShangs.htm">(Various Turtles At Yinxu)</a> The slight number of other types of bones like ox discovered along with turtle bones could demonstrate such kind of shortages.</p>
		<p>
			Although we know little about the manufactouring process, from the large amount of unearthed bronzes, we can concieve how many materials, times, labors, techonlogies, corperations etc. it would need. For example, the famous Si-Mu-Wu tetripod weighs 832.84 kilograms(1,925 pounds). We can find that bones and bronzes are most expansive man-made consuming products among all unearthed materials at Anyng.</p>
		<p>
			With the engrave skills used on bones, it was feasible to freely inscribe any characters on any cheaper materials like bamboos, wood, stones, procelines, pottery, or even clay etc. However, archeologist could&nbsp; find just about twenty characters on several jades and stones [ChenZhiDa], some characters on potteries[XuZhenLei] at TBI times. As a sharp contrast to BB, we can clearly see that there existed a boundary of material usage for the writings. Through this boundary we can see that there existed a protocol at TBI times that could be maintained by the rulers or the religious believes. Such regulation was similar to the restrictions of the usage of stones in the NT account[Exod20_25]. If those cases were authentic, the limited numbers of characters on pottery, jades and stones were the illegal cases we could find at the TBI times.</p>
		<p>
			Many archeologist believed that aboundant books or documents in forms of bamboos or clothes etc. must have ever existed at TBI times due to its advanced techonlogy and florish society. The existance of characters of &#39;Ce&#39;, &#39;Dian&#39;, &#39;Shu&#39; in TBI and the discovery of limited number of red and black ink marks on some turtle bones and color painted plotters[AnyanLiJi_P87_126] can support this. However, could find coffin woods[XiaotunWestReport] and even the leaves of plants at Anyang[WangShuzhi_LuChao], but we could not find any books.</p>
		<p>
			Besides, among large amount of unearthed materials, there were no any idoltry and adultry (IA) either in artifacts or in scriptions, nor luxuary materials for living or entertainments etc associated with BB. The whole religious ceremony showed sacred. It was the such sacredness that could successfuly maintain the BBO protocol no matter how expansive they were.</p>
		<p>
			Some scholars call Heiroglyphics as &#39;god&#39;s words&#39; , &#39;sacred words&#39;, the sacred engraved letters (圣书体) etc. Indeed, hieroglyphics appeared anywhere from bronzes to papyrus, wood, stone, even on bricks etc. in ancient Egypt. Some hieroglyphics also contains adultry icons. As comparison, TBI was much more sacred than Hierogplycs and hence TBI was more adquate to be entitled as &#39;sacred characters&#39; than Hierogplycs.</p>
		<p>
			The BBO phenonmenon is the result of BBO rule that demonstrated that the TBI were not intented to be used for human communications or culture exchanges etc. but purely to the high for the sacred religious purpose -- that was one of reasons that made us difficult to understand the TBI since we do not know what they believed.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. The Earliest Four Documents From BB</strong></p>
		<p>
			Although we have found hundreds of thousands of earliest characters at Anyang, no any documents or books for human being had ever been found. This once made many archeologist very disappointed. All of inscriptions were only written on bones and bronzes known for religions purpose rather than for human being conmunications or their offsprings.</p>
		<p>
			However, in TBI, there does have a root pictograms Che denoting the &#39;book&#39; or &#39;document&#39; -- a piece of written or printed materials that provides information that serves as an official record for human reading and applying. Many archeologist kept insisting that some forms of books or documents must have ever existed at TBI times even with the BBO phenonmenon.</p>
		<p>
			If we consider any document that was clearly intented to be writen for human beings or their offsprings not for any religious ritual purpose, they have to be the decimal Numeration system (N),&nbsp; Heaven-stems (H), Earth-branches (E) and Sexturgent system (S) widely applied in TBI. These four documents were remained and used until today. However, for long time in history, people did not treat them as documents, so its rich information and thoughts compiled in the documents were nearly lost. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			We could not find any evidences that N,H,E,S were gradually formed during the hundreds of years of practices during TBI times. On the countary, all evidences showed that TBI and BI strictly followed the rules from these documents without any exceptions. This further confirmed that these four collectons of serias of characters were the earliest documents before the TBI practices started.</p>
		<p>
			As discussed early, with OOA method, we knew that N contians information about how the characters were created. With BE method, we can find that the contents of N in many places were similar to the Genesis account. The character &#39;one&#39; contains the information about the begining of the world. The character &#39;five&#39; could be used to infer birds in the sky and fish in the sea. The character &#39;six&#39;, a house, could denote that the first human being was created, the house also could be used to denote the forthcoming church that was prepared for human. The character &#39;seven&#39;, the day of the rest, is presented with the cross -- the forth coming symbol in Gospel.&nbsp; The &#39;eight&#39; denotes the flood. The &#39;nine&#39; denotes the snake. The &#39;ten&#39; could denote the road or fulfill. (See <a href="./5.___05_Earliest_Doc2.htm">table</a>)&nbsp; From these analysis, we can summarized that N contains at least following informations:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				how the characters were created -- about the initition of Chinese writing languages.</li>
			<li>
				how the number was used -- about the rules, mathmatics, ten based and seven based counting.</li>
			<li>
				how the world was created -- about laws, history, phylosophy, religions, prophacy, salvation and Gospels etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The document H, E and S are more closely related and dependent to each other than to N. Noticed that all 22 characters in H and E can be seamlessly applied to intepret the story of Gospel, including&nbsp; the most important character for &#39;God&#39;, two types of &#39;cross&quot;,&nbsp; four types of &#39;son&#39;, three types of weapons,&nbsp; manger, pregnant, scapegoat etc. (See <a href="./5.___05_Earliest_Doc2.htm">table</a>) If we consider N as OT, than H-E-S can be considered as NT.</p>
		<p>
			From logical viewpoint, the document H and E must exist earlier than S. The 60 in S is the least common denominator of 10 in H and 12 in E.&nbsp; The first phase in S contains the intensified meaning about the cross and the son of manger. The S was used as day counting at TBI times. But in history S had been used as year counting for long time until today. The first year in S happened in 4 BC that was close to the first year of Gregorian we used today.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			All of these demonstrated that the information contained in these four earliest and shortest Chinese documents are much more than what we can imagine for today. From the realistic existance view point, it was natural that what the four virtical bars in the pictogram Ce <img alt="" height="23" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/61741.gif" width="23" />implied were the four documents that we discovered here, but, at the same time, from the prophacy intention, the four virtical lines of codes could also infer the four books in Gospel&nbsp; -- the ultimate destination -- the perfect polymorphism in OOA -- the satisfying EZ method.</p>
		<p>
			The four earliest documents N,H,E and S were closely related and undividable -- they formed integrated one unit, one book or one document. This was the reason why the four books were sealed together just as what its pictographic displayed.</p>
		<p>
			This discovery of the earliest book brought TBI study into a new era and opened a new ground -- pre-TBI. The TBI was not the earliest characters any more -- they were just the first usage or the earlist application of the preTBI -- the earliest one book with four documents. From here we can see that stead of study the TBI, we should concentrate more efforts on pre-TBI study -- the earliest book, whereas what the earliest book utilmately pointed to was the OT and NT where the book came from.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. The Nature of the Book</strong></p>
		See <a href="./5.__05_4120_TBI_Book_Nature.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			The character Ce has been in use all the time in Chinse history until today, even though they did not know what kind of book the character of &#39;Ce&#39; 册 implied to. With the discovery of TBI, through friends of Ce, we can at least get some atitudes or evaluation information about this book from its earliest users at TBI times.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The book is about the &#39;son&#39;<br />
				<br />
				See <a href="./5.__05_4120_TBI_Book_Friends.htm">(*)</a>.
				<br />
				Among all different friends of Ce, the &#39;son&#39; was the best buddy. Along with the &#39;son&#39;, there are more inforamtion including &#39;forthcoming&#39;, &#39;king&#39;, &#39;manger&#39;, &#39;snake&#39; about the book -- all of these consistent to the descriptiong about the Gospel. Unfortunately all of these characters were lost in history. No simplified charcters can match them up.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The book is sacred<br />
				<br />
				See <a href="./5.__05_4120_TBI_Book_Divine.htm">(*)</a>.
				<br />
				The book raised by two nailed-cross hand and on the altar was to represent the holy or sacred book. This character was still in use for today. But most of time it used as name for dictionary.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The friends of &#39;book&#39; clearly told us that the &#39;book&#39; that it implied to was a special book about the son. With statistic method to analyze there four books, we also got the same results -- the &#39;son&#39; has four different types more than weapon (3) and others.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. The Modification of the Book</strong></p>
		<p>
			Before the Chinese charaters were sealed during Chin-Han 秦漢 Dynasty Characters (221 BC - 200 AD), Chinese writing system experienced the long bitter characters war -- changing or keeping -- revolution or conservation -- usually resulted in compromised changing or reforms. This struggling can be seen through the Chinese etymology analysis.</p>
		<p>
			In the earliest book, (See <a href="./5.___05_Earliest_Doc2.htm">table</a>)&nbsp; we can find that, except the first three characters kept unchanged in book N, all other characters more or less were modified in shapes of writing. The worse thing is that the ordered sequence of the codes were also changed through the modifications. Such alternation can be summerized into following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In document N, the number &#39;ten&#39; was gradually replaced by the cross symbol which originally represent &#39;seven&#39;, whereas the &#39;seven&#39; was modified from straight cross to the curved like a snake.; the vertical bar character was erased from the oldest books.</li>
			<li>
				In document H, the first item Jia was gradually modified from simple cross to a complicated new word called Jia.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			These modification essentially change the critical concept of the cross, mutated or derailed the original spirits in the earliest book, broken the connection between the N, H and E as well as its prediction roles. From here we can see that from the begining in the earliest book, Chinese people had modification motivation. The modification led to derail the people -- the evidence for the human devolution.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>6. Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			The discovery of the earliest book brought TBI study into a new era and opened a new ground -- pre-TBI. The TBI was not the earliest characters any more -- they were just the first usage or the earlist application of the preTBI -- the earliest book with four documents that contained all information about the origin of Chinese writing system as well as its culture. From here we can see that stead of study the TBI, we should focus more on pre-TBI study -- the earliest book, whereas what the earliest book utilmately pointed to was the OT and NT.</p>

			<strong>Consistent Unification on Hot Characters</strong></p>
		<p>
			If we apply statistic analysis method to compare the top three most frequently used words between the bronzes and bones, we can find that the main topic on bronzes is about &#39;Father&#39;, &#39;Cross&#39; and &#39;Son&#39;; whereas on oracle bones it is about &#39;Zhen&#39;, &#39;Bu&#39; and &#39;King&#39;. (see table: <a href="./5.___05_Tbl-Words-Statistic-Analysis.htm">Words Freqency Statistic Analysis and Comparison</a>)&nbsp; In Chinese, the Zhen could means the &#39;chastity&#39;, &#39;pure&#39;, &#39;virtuous&#39;, &#39;incorruptible&#39;,&#39;dedication&#39;, &#39;devotion&#39;. The &#39;King&#39; could mean the &#39;ruler&#39;, &#39;power&#39;, &#39;mighty&#39;. From the biblical view points, we can easily find that both &#39;Zhen&#39; and &#39;King&#39; are part of attributes that closely related to the &#39;Father-Cross-Son&#39;.&nbsp; Then what is the meaning of Bu?</p>
		<p>
			From Chinese historic books, the Bu was commonly used with Turtle bones, for example, 龟卜,卜甲,卜骨 . This make sense, since Bu was one of top three most frequently used words on turtle bones. In Chinese historic books, Bu was widely considered as the meaning of superstions. The earliest widely quoted explaination can be found in Shuowen that Bu was similar in picture to the burn crack on turtle. It makes sense that using randomly turtle cracks to determine the future is superstious. However, how turtle cracks were practically operated to determine the future were not known until today.&nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			As matter of facts, Zhen is the top most frequently used word on turtle bones. Also Zhen and Bu were commonly appeared in the same sentence on bones inscriptions -- this could explain why we can see phrase ZhenBu. (for example, 《左传&middot;哀公十七年》：衞侯贞卜。) Here we can see how equally they co-existed in usage between Zhen and Bu. However, in historic books, Zhen was not used with turtle bones as Bu did -- Zhen was not selected as key word to represent the whole essential purpose of bones inscriptions.</p>
		<p>
			The meaning of Zhen was quite different from Bu. Some scholars explained that, in picture, Zhen is similar to the bronze Ding -- that could well explain where the meaning of Zhen came from. From the religious view points, we can see that Zhen is not compatible to Bu. But Bu domain the main topic of bones inscriptions in historic books. If we switch the roles of Bu and Zhen in historic books, then the whole chinese history will be different.<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Due to the closeness between Zhen and Bu, the meaning that was assigned to one, will affect the other. If Bu means superstitions, then Zhen would also infer superstitions; That could explain why Zhen sometimes used as way of Bu to present the superstions, for example, in YiJing [_yijing_zhenxiong]. Similarly, due to closeness between bones and bronzes, if bones were oracle, then bronzes were oracle too; then whole chinese characers were superstitions; tombs were superstations; the whole Shang dynasty were superstitious; However, in historic books, Bronzes were was seldomly considered as superstitions.&nbsp; They were widely considered as symbols of the owner&#39;s political power or royal family status. Obviously such historic interpretion of Bu has conflictions and is questionable.</p>
		<p>
			One of the commonly used compund character of&nbsp; Bu (訃,讣) was not found in OTI, but it appeared in one of ealiest history books LiJi.[_BuGao]&nbsp; It means obituary (讣告, 讣帖, 报丧的子) -- that is quite different from the meaning of &#39;superstitious foretell&quot; and was formally used until today. This meaning is consistent to the compound unknown word of Bu2 <img class="m" height="27" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/60551.gif" width="27" /><img class="m" height="27" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/60566.gif" width="27" />in OBI that is related to the &#39;burrials&#39; or &#39;tomb&#39;. This could shed some light that original meaning of Bu on OBI had other meaning rather than what we defined today the meaning of &quot;superstitious foretelling&quot;.</p>
		<p>
			Another commonly used compound word in OBI was Zhan<img class="m" height="24" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/60568.gif" width="24" />. It was commonly used with Bu to form a phrase ZhanBu 占卜<img class="m" height="25" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/60568.gif" width="25" /><img class="m" height="25" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/60569.gif" width="25" />in history and was still in use for today. In bones scriptions, Zhan <img class="m" height="22" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/60568.gif" width="22" />was compound word composed of Bu <img class="m" height="19" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/60569.gif" width="19" />and Mouth<img class="m" height="20" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/58283.gif" width="20" /> which mean to speak. By means of today&#39;s religious terminology, to speak with god was commonly called &#39;pray&#39; -- which could be used to better describe the original meaning of Bu.</p>
		<p>
			Superficially there is no significant differences between pray and superstitions. When people lost their original true faith, their pray and all religious activities became the superstitions, especially in eyes of on-lookers. To simply define Bu as superstitions could not accurately reflect its whole original essence. When we can restore the original meaning of Bu, we can find that all characters on bones and bronzes were in one harmony unity to serve for one unique purpose -- the worship.</p>
		<p>
			How to interpret the original meaning of Bu is critical for OBI study. It could change our ways to view not only the Shang but also whole Chinese history. The foundimental critical issue of Bu is that we don&#39;t know how exactly the turtle bones cracks was used to determine the future.&nbsp; Is this Chinese historic account reliable? This lead us to study on the turtle bones burn marks in lab, and we found that the turtle bones burn and cracks are independent and they has nothing to do with fortune fortelling.&nbsp; (see report)</p>
		<p>
			Although bones and bronzes are so closely related in our study of Shang culture, they also found that they played different but important roles in history.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Bronze were mainly burried in tombs, turtle bones were mainly in ash pitch in temple area. The life cycle of turtle bones was short; bronze will accompy the death and remain forever.</li>
			<li>
				In history, to inscript text on bones were suddenly permantly terminated after Shang, but to cast characters on bronzes were smoothly remained until bamboo books appeared in history and extended in use until today.</li>
			<li>
				characters freq distribution different. bronzes are more pictures or logo or art; bones are more literatures or scripture. bronzes has only 300 characters; bones contain 6000 characters. all characters in bronze can be found in bones. bronzes are more<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			In summary, bones and bronzes are closely related to each others not only in that they both coexist at the same Shang times period, used in same place&nbsp;for same&nbsp;religious riuals, but also in that they were the only two medias to carry the very original characters, harmonly cooperating to each others, to perform one unique purpose -- what we called the religious worship. It was the buggy character Bu that mislead us to split up our attitudes to treat them differently. To simply define the bones as superstition practice could not accurately reflect the original whole essence.</p>

		<p>
			There were only about 300 different meaning of words&nbsp;were found&nbsp;among total&nbsp;about 8k words on all kinds of bronzes. Whereas about 6k different words and total of 610k words were found on turtle bones. Almost all words found on bronzes could be found the matched words in turtle bones. Words in bonzes could be considered as a subset of words in turtle bones.</p>
		<p>
			Thru the statistics in <a href="./5.___05_Tbl-Words-Statistic-Analysis.htm">table</a>, we can find that, the most frequently used word in turtle bones&nbsp;came from&nbsp;the picture of&nbsp;most commonly used in bronze vessal (called Din in pinyin). This fact implied that the central topic of all words in turtle bones was pointed to the bronze Din in tombs.</p>
		<p>
			Also from the statistics, we can find that the most freqently used word in bonzes is the word &#39;Father&#39;. (called Fu in pinyin). Thru OOA word analysis, we can find that the word &#39;Father&#39; is the combination of a rod and a&nbsp;hand,&nbsp;and means lifted-up- the-rod-with-hand. From the anlysis of friends of &#39;Father&#39;, we can conclude that&nbsp;the meaning of the word&nbsp;&#39;Father&#39; is&nbsp;far beyond&nbsp;the biological father&nbsp;in parents animal. The hand in the word &#39;Father&#39; inherits from the word &#39;CROSS&#39;. so the word &#39;Father&#39; is related to what the &#39;CROSS&#39; implied.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Among all discoveries in Yinxu, the top valuables man made artifacts are: turtle bones, bronzes and words. The turtle bones that once carried all inital Chinese words immedieatly disappeared in history after Shang Dynasty. The brones lasted several thousands of years but not used today. Only words,&nbsp;that is now carried by&nbsp;diginal computers,&nbsp;are kept still in use until today.</p>
		<p>
			If Chinese words were not intially intended to predict what was manifested today, no matter how authentic the pictorgrams could reflect&nbsp;from&nbsp;the world, they would be disappeared eventually, like turtle bones or bronzes. It was this characteristic that Chinese words could continue to prevail in globalization times.</p>
		<p>
			Also we can deduct that the very initial purpose of turtle bones were the same as what the bronzes intended but with the different styles. Turtle bones were not intended to be used as superstitious divinations.</p>
