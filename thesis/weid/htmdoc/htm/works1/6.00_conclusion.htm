				There are two cultures in the world --&nbsp; the western and eastern. The western cultre uses phonetic language. The eastern uses the logograms. The western world could not exist without the bible. Since if poeple lost it during the falling process, there is no way to find them back. Whereas the eastern world could still exist without the bible. Since the info what the bible revealed were already rooted into each characters silently. In essence, there is no confliction at all between western and eastern. Both cultures are the same in history in that they have to struggle to keep the original words in the unresistable devolution process.</li>
