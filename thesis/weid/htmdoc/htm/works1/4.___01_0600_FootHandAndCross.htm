			There are two types of words to denote &#39;hand&#39; in tbi times. Here we classify them as cross hand and animal hand.</p>
		<h3>
			Cross Hand of Savor:</h3>
		<p>
			This types of word belongs to logography. Because it is derived from the logo word CROSS.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross hand appeared two forms- one is for left side, another is for the right. However, there is no significant&nbsp;differences in meaning between these two forms when they are used to&nbsp;compose of the compound words. See table of friends of cross hand.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			In the tree, we can see that the cross hand has children root which is used to compose many other words.</p>
		<h3>
			Animal Hand of Siner:</h3>
		<p>
			This word belongs to pictography. Since visually speaking, it looks like a claw.&nbsp; The animal hand has not difference in form or meaning&nbsp;between left and right side.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Both cross hand and animal hand are used as root to make up composite word.&nbsp;In some cases, the animal hand and cross hand are&nbsp;equivalent and they&nbsp;are interchangable in meaning in composite word. see table.&nbsp; In&nbsp;couple of cases, the animal hand and cross hand appared&nbsp;at the same time. ( <a href="../../../../oophp/app_dbm/db_view.php?sql=SELECT+*+FROM+Jiaguwen+WHERE+jink+LIKE+%27%2558515%2558563%2C%25%27+ORDER+BY+jink&amp;sss=">see table&nbsp;</a> <span style="font-size: 9px;"><a href="../../../../oophp/app_dbm/db_view.php?sql=SELECT+*+FROM+Jiaguwen+WHERE+jink+LIKE+%27%2558515%2558563%2C%25%27+ORDER+BY+jink&amp;sss=">(SQL: SELECT * FROM Jiaguwen WHERE jink LIKE &#39;%58515%58563,%&#39;&nbsp;)</a>&nbsp;</span> ) In most cases, cross hand can not be replaced by animal hands.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			As compared with the pictogrphic animal hand, the logographic cross hand is strange to many people&#39;s eyes. Because it does not look like a hand. Thru the friends of cross hands, we can conclude that strangeness is made by originator on purpose.&nbsp;It told us that the cross hand is not a generic normal hand. It is a special hand, the hand from cross, the hand of the son on the cross. This sense leads to the connection of nailed hand descripted in gospal. Obviously chinese&nbsp;people lost the original sense during the history, the cross hand is gradually fully replaced by animal hand. This can be seen to start since&nbsp;the bronze times.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The concept of specialness demonstrated here between cross hand and animal hand can also apply to the other words in tbi. If we look at the early painting of mother and son, we know that the son&nbsp;is not generic common&nbsp;child or boy. it is specifically to point to the son of man on cross. Same thing, the mother&nbsp;is not the common mother or common women, it is specifically denoted to&nbsp;the virgin Mary mentioned in gospal.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The specialness of woman in tbi can be demonstrated in two folds:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				thru the friends of woman.</li>
			<li>
				The asymetric gender phenomina over all tbi. No pictographic words for male.&nbsp;many&nbsp;words for&nbsp;people. &nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
