		<h3>
			Friends Of Cross In TBI</h3>
		<p>
			There is no argument among scholars that the CROSS in&nbsp;TBI denotes two different meanings:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				SEVERN in the numbers (see <a href="./Tbl-Numeric-Words-Comperison.htm">table </a>)</li>
			<li>
				FIRST in&nbsp;heaven-sterms (see <a href="./Tbl-Date-Time-Expression-Method.htm">table </a>)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			But none of these two meanings is helpful to decode&nbsp;large mount of compound characters containing the symbol of CROSS that we do not know until today. By applying KMC method,&nbsp;we collected all his&nbsp;well-known friends, the already recongized characters&nbsp;of CROSS togather. (<a href="./4.___00_Tbl-FriendsOfCross_typical.htm">see table</a>). &nbsp;Obviously, in&nbsp;literal, these compound characters&nbsp;do not make sense: seven/first eyes, seven/first peoples, seven/first houses, seven/first fathers, seven/first sheep, seven/first snakes etc.</p>
		<p>
			However,&nbsp;by&nbsp;applying the BE method, we can find that&nbsp;&nbsp;all of these items,&nbsp;eyes (look for), people, stones (tombs), buildings (church), fathers, kings, sheep, snakes etc in biblical account&nbsp;has keen relationship to the cross stated in NT. By visually thinking these characters with biblical view point, all characters became significantly meaningful and known (see more&nbsp;characters with cross[<a href="./4.___00_Tbl-FriendsOfCross_all.htm">*</a>]). Hence, we can conclude that, the symbol of CROSS in TBI has more meanings besides SEVEN in number and FIRST in stems.</p>
		<p>
			Among all characters in TBI, the CROSS is the only symbol we have found that&nbsp;can be&nbsp;used to represent&nbsp;two completely different meanings in two different sequences&nbsp;of two different domains (heaven-stem and numeric numbers). This could be the another hint and reason to drive us to propose that the CROSS could have more meanings than SEVEN and FIRST stem.</p>
		<p>
			Obviously, one symbol to represents two different literal meanings, the SEVEN in numbers and the FIRST in heaven-stems order, could bring readers very confusing in the texts reading. The usage and meaning of the CROSS was gradually modified during Zhou dynasty right after Shang Dynasty (see table[<a href="./7.___01_Tbl-Word-Deviation-Exchange.htm">*</a>] ). Since then, the CROSS became only one unique meaning of TEN in number in Chinese and used until today. The literal meaning and usage of CROSS became simple and clear since then, but the original invention purpose of the CROSS in TBI was then totally lost. This is one of regretful evidences of the human devolution&nbsp;in Chinese people.</p>
		<p>
			As we will&nbsp; discuss later, there are more evidences that can be found that the CROSS in TBI has keen connection in&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;to the cross that is stated in both OT and NT.&nbsp;For example, the chaper of &nbsp;<a class="view" href="./0200_VariationOfCross.htm" title="/var/www/lamp/wroot/publish/030_analysis/020_Evidence-Inside_TBI/logograph/0200_VariationOfCross.htm">Variation Of Cross</a>.</p>
