				The earliest dictionary in chinese history that was called ShuoWen (600AD) was really not necessary and indeed it produced lots of errors and misleading.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Grammar free:<br />
				<br />
				Since the image and meaning are encapsulated in word, the sequence of words is the sequence of image,&nbsp;which&nbsp;become a vivid moving picture - vedio.

				<br />
				<br />
				The earliest Chinese grammar book was written in English by Robert Morrison[RobertMorrison] in 1815. Later on, the Chinese scholar Ma JianZhong[MaJianZhong] published the book of Wen Tong 文通 in 1898, that was the first book about Chinese grammar writen in Chinese.&nbsp;<br />
