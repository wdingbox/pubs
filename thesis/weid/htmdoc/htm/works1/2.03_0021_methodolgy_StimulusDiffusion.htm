			Stimulus Diffusion (SD) Theory</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Stimulus Diffusion (SD) Theory</strong></p>
		<p>
			According to merriam-webster, Stimulus Diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;(SD) is a kind of diffusion in which one people receives a culture element from another but gives it a new and unique form. Stimulus diffusion was first published on American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 42, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1940), pp. 1-20&nbsp;by Alfred Louis Kroeber (June 11, 1876 &ndash; October 5, 1960). &quot;It occurs in situations where a system or pattern as such encounters no resistance to its spread, but there are difficulties in regard to the transmission of the concrete contents of the system. In this case it is the idea of the complex or system which is accepted, but it remains for the receiving culture to develop a new content. This somewhat special process might therefore be called &#39;idea-diffusion&#39; or &#39;stimulus-diffusion&#39;.&quot; [Kroeber]</p>

			For long time, Chinese archeologist believe that Chinese race came from local Chinese apes (for example, Beijing Apes), and its civilization was purely the result of its own independent development, invention and envolution process. We could not find western thoughts in Chinese pre-Qin books. The Chinese writing sytem, culture and thoughts are quite different from western. From official archeological research and reports, we could not find any direct inter-culture communication evidence in history.&nbsp;The terrian of China is broad and copious enough to provide full natural environments to form its own complicated home-made system.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;The earliest detailed descriptions about western culture appeared in Shiji 《史记.大宛列传》(139 BC). The earliest foriegn phrase appeared in. that made it difference from west or other areas. Any outside affection of Chinese culture was considered as negtive destroctive invader for their folstering. SD theory can help us to understand that Chinese culture is not the isolated system but the parts of and being derived from earlier western culture.</p>

			现代以前，汉语曾使用过&ldquo;译语&rdquo;&ldquo;译名&rdquo;&ldquo;译词&rdquo;&ldquo;外国语&rdquo;等词来指称外来词。 &ldquo;译语&rdquo;唐代首先开始使用，指经过翻译的语词。至明清两代即开始用&ldquo;译语&rdquo;来命名译馆（会同馆、四夷馆）所编撰之&ldquo;华夷译语&rdquo;。同时还有使用至今的&ldquo;译名&rdquo;，但含义笼统，既可指意译词也可指音译词。随着&ldquo;词&rdquo;的概念和名称在汉语中出现并固定下来，也开始出现&ldquo;译词&rdquo;一名。&ldquo;外国语&rdquo;则是通俗说法，并非正式的术语。</div>

			外来语[编辑]</div>
		<div>
			近代作为正式的科学术语是从「外来语」开始的。「外来语」一词是20世纪初（1902年）从日语借入的，一直到1950年代初，主要限于指完全或部分音译的词，此外还增指从日语借入的汉字词。现在「外来语」主要在日语学界及台湾的语言学家，以及在讨论外来词范围的问题时使用，而「外来词」主要由中国大陆学者使用。</div>

				&quot;Obviously this process is one which will ordinarily leave a minimum of historical evidence. In a great many cases in history, as just pointed out, evidence as to the process of diffusion is much more scant than of the effects. In other words, much diffusion takes place below the surface of historical record. The evidence for it is therefore indirect or inferred, although the conclusions may be none the less indubitable&quot; [Kroeber] (p1)</div>

			As a case study, the author analyzed the SD relationship for writing system between Chinese and Mesopotamia. &quot;4. It is a natural step for inference to pass from these historic examples of the origin of systems of writing to those whose origin is still veiled in obscurity. Not that we can use the principle of idea-diffusion to assign a specific origin to Egyptian or Mesopotamian or Chinese writing, but the principle does at least come into consideration as a possibility. Particularly is this true when we find writing appearing on the cultural scene at more or less the same time in countries so close together as Egypt and Mesopotamia. The time-space relation is such as inevitably to suggest a connection. On the other hand, the Egyptian and Mesopotamian characters, their sound values where they represent sounds, and in part the principles employed are so different that all attempts to derive cuneiform from hieroglyphic or vice versa have been rejected as insufficient and forced. It is, however, entirely possible that after writing had developed in one of the two areas, knowledge of the possibility and advantages of writing was carried to the other area; and that because of this stimulus someone in the second area devised a system to fit his native language, customary thought processes, and available technological materials; with the result that the specific system evolved was totally or preponderantly diverse from the one which had stimulated its invention. As between Mesopotamia and China, the geographical gap is considerably greater, and the lapse of time between first appearances is probably also greater. However, the system of strokes composing the characters is undeniably somewhat alike. That Terrien de Lacouperie&#39;s (https://archive.org/stream/earlychinesewrit00chalrich#page/n75/mode/2up) old attempt to show a connection through specific similarities of form and meaning of characters is a failure, may be unhesitatingly accepted along with the majority of scholars. Nevertheless, there does remain the possibility of a real connection through the transmission of the idea of writing and of this acting as a stimulus toward an original but induced local invention, presumably in China. &quot;[Kroeber]&nbsp;</div>

			The sudden appearnce of chariots in China along with TBI at the same time and same site at Anyang could not let us deny the connection of horse, wheel and languages at ancient times[HorseWheelLanguage]. &nbsp;The chariot discovered in 1933 at Hougang, Anyang can be dated back to 1200 BC.&nbsp;found the TBI with same image. &nbsp;in Henan province,1936年，在河南省安阳市殷墟车马坑中，首次出土一辆商朝战车。[HorseWheelLanguage]</div>

			For example, if we compare the top five civilizations in the world, we can find that there have a time delay in its origination. More over, we can also find an a<span style="text-align: center;">pproximate&nbsp;</span>linear time-space relation among them -- the more delayed in time, the further in distance. Besides, all civilization are located around N32 degree, mainly in Asia contenents, which is relatively small areas as compared to earth surface, and which made the mutual simulus possible. Such indirect evidences inevitably suggest there exists stimulus diffusion connection among world civilizations.&nbsp;<a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Top5WorldCivilizationInHistory.htm">(TopFiveCivilizations)</a></div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Similarly, we can also find the time-space propotional relationship among ancient chariots unearthed at different sites in world with different dates in history. It suggests that the idea or invention of chariot was sparked at one place and then spread around over the world. <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Top5WorldCivilization_Chariots_Spread_In_History.htm">(AncientChariotsSpreadAndDistributions)</a>. &nbsp;The discovery of whole elegant chariots in Anyang of Shang Dynasty(about 1300~1200 BC) further enhanced that the sudden emerged chaioits over China was the results of the diffusion.</div>

			Stimulus diffusion is the transmission of the underlying invisible principles, its superfacial characteristic or tangible contents fail to spread and&nbsp;may look like completely different. For example, the heiroglyphics and TBI are considered as two independent languages developed at two remote isolated places. However, both of them use small images as words. Each has OOA features to form its all about 6,000 characters based on about 2000 root characters. The time-intelligence relationship between them -- the later has the more abstractions of the pictures -- suggest that the heiroglyphics sparked the invention of TBI. &nbsp;The discovered about 400 matched characters in shape&nbsp;underscore their stimulus diffusion connect between them. <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Hieroglyphics_TBI_similarities.htm">(SamplesOfSimilaritiesHieroglyphicsTBI)</a></div>

			diffusion in which one people receives a culture element from another but gives it a new and unique form.&nbsp;It was initially limited in the discussion of the concrete or specific elements for culture materials in certain areas within certain times, like porcelain, alphabets, Japanese furniture, Chinese drama, etc. This paper suggests that Stimulus Diffusion theory can be extended to the&nbsp;world wide civilization development. All human culture are related and its differences could stimulate each other to cause to development. This can be seen from following different aspects:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Time(Time frame in thousands of years, 500BC concurrence)<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Space, North latitude 32, longtidute .&nbsp;<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Time-Space distribution&nbsp;relationship.<br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>

				The discovery of whole elegant chariots in Anyang (about 1300~1200 BC) provided unarguable solid evidence that the vehicles were undividable part of all earliest cultures. The world wide popularity of vehicles in ancient time made it possible for telecommunication among them. With the carriage unearthed in Anyang in Shang dynasty in 1953, driven by a slow horse that walks 30 mile a day with 200 days a year, it only takes about two years for people to travel from central China to the most west of Asia continent with the help of knowledge of astronomy.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Throughout the world wide early civilization development in archeology, we can find that the geographical distance to the most ancient site is proportional to the time emerged in history <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Top5WorldCivilizationInHistory.htm">(TopFiveCivilizations)</a>. Similar phenomenon can be found on chariots discovery in archeology <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Top5WorldCivilization_Chariots_Spread_In_History.htm">(AncientChariotsSpreadAndDistributions)</a>.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Through the study of about 400 full body human skulls unearthed at Anyang from the Shang Dynasty, the scholars found that the population in ancient Shang had considerable variation with majority of Mongoloid type and minority of possible of Caucasoid and Oceanic Negroids, although the racial relationship and the immigration motivation were still unclear so far[AnyangLiJi] [YuZhouHumanTeethAnalysis]. This could demonstrate that the visitors exchange through north-west already existed between China and the Western during Shang Dynasty. The discovery of SilkRoad could also support the exisitance of the ancient international communications.&nbsp;This finding also inferred that the ancient Chinese maybe came from the tribe of Mongolia, who first settle down in east. The observation of similarities between Chinese and Mongolia, the frequent Mongolia invasion of China, the defensive Great Wall, as well as some period governed by Mongolia in China, and so on, all of these show how close and familiar to each other they were.<br />

				Between around 600 BC and 200 BC, the most influential classic philosophers, suddenly emerged globally. This is not a coincident. It is an evidence of the existence of internal communication and coordination among different part of the world with different cultures. It is part of harmony and consistency of the world civilization.<br />

				Among all unearthed turtle bones in Anyang, there is a large amount of heterogeneous species of turtle shells, some of them were imported thousands of miles away from Malay Peninsular. The centralized city in Shang Dynasty at Anyang also has exhibited the development level of transportation at that time. It shows the civilization development at Anyang was not isolated locally <a href="./5.___05_Tbl-Spices-of-Turtle-ShellsInShangs.htm">(TurtlesTypesInAnyan)</a>.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>

			The stimulus diffusion (SD) theory suggested that all different civilizations over the world were not originated independently in the purely isolated ground from zero. They all seeded and inherited from one root ancestor -- that is consistent to the Genesis account. Besides, there were connections remained all the time in history among the remotely distributed different cultures during their relatively independent constructions within their geographically or politically segregated state. The chariot was one of the examples as a media carriers for messages exchanges among them at ancient times. It was these connections that made all different cultures consistent and unity in a high level, no matter how capriciously and differently they were when we look into each of them in detail. The period between about 600~200 BC is an example of the harmony in human thoughts developments in the global history. To be better understand the TBI, we have to keep the extended stimulus diffusion theory in mind.</p>

			For long time, Chinese archeologist believe that Chinese people came from local Chinese apes, and its civilization was purely the result of its own independent development, invention and envolution process, since its terrian is broad and rich enough to contain all kinds of elements needed to form its own complicated system that made it difference from west or other areas. Any outside affection of Chinese culture was considered as negtive destroctive invader for their folstering. SD theory can help us to understand that Chinese culture is not the isolated system but the parts of and being derived from earlier western culture.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			However, this has brought many mystery issues unsolved today. If we apply ESD into TBI study, the issue can be simply resolved. As matter of facts, as more and mor evidences were uncovered, some Chinese scholars has began to believe that that chinese civlization was not developed purely independently in isolated far eastern kingdom even it was hard to access due to its strict natural protecting bindaries with highest mountain along south and west, the ocean in the east, the dissert in the north. (refere to&nbsp;<a href="../../../../../../___bigdata/___compact/___incrementalRO/pub/links/pubdata/SilkRoadBeforeHan/silkroadBeforeHan.html">SilkeRoadBeforeHan</a>). &nbsp;</p>

			<strong>2. Heiroglyphics and TBI Comparison (HTC) Analysis Method </strong></p>
		<p>
			It was not hard for us to find that there exist some ESD relationship between Hierogplyphics and TBI. Hierogplyphics started thousands year earlier than TBI. Both of them belong to pictograms writing system. Our further study showed that they have following similarities between them.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Both of them have more than about 6,000 different characters or icons including roots for about one thousands for TBI and about 2,695 for Hierogplyphics.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Both of them have OOA features -- consisted of compound and root characters or iconics, and there exist similar OOA hierachy tree families for composition of compound characters or icons.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Contrast to TBI, it did not need visual thinking energy for people to recongize each character of Hierogplyphics. However, due to the one to one relationship between the real image of object and character of hierogplyphics, it undermined the polymorphism fefatures of OOA.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Nearly about 400 root characters in TBI can visually match the icons of the Hierogplyphics. See typical samples in <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Hieroglyphics_TBI_similarities.htm">(SamplesOfSimilaritiesHieroglyphicsTBI)</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Based on above similarities and ESD theory, this paper proposed a Heirogplyphics and TBI Comparsion (HTC) anaylysis method, which contains two steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				To apply all our proposed analysis methods on both TBI and Hierogplyphics.</li>
			<li>
				To compare the analysis results between TBI and Hierogplyphics to find the common features to support each others.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The advantage of HTC method for TBI study is that it can help us to better understand the abstracted character through plain picture of Hieroglyphics. The disadvantage is that Hieroglyphics may mislead us to understand the deep thoughts that TBI may have.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			There exist many hard archeological evidences to support the ESD theory that further enhanced the BE method.</p>
