					The Book of the Music(乐经)</p>
				<p>
					There are large amount of unearthed bronze music instruments before Qing Dynasty (221BC). Obviously ancient people could play elegant complicated music. The name of the Music was mentioned in other classical books. (先秦有《乐经》存世。此说不仅见于传世文献《庄子&middot;天下》篇，从郭店楚简中也得到了证实。郭店简《六德》说：&ldquo;观诸《诗》、《书》则亦载矣，观诸 《礼》、《乐》则亦载矣，观诸《易》、《春秋》则亦载矣。&rdquo;简中另一篇《语丛（一）》也有&ldquo;六经&rdquo;并称之语。). But we could not find any ancient books regarding the music in detail. Many scholars believe that the book of the Music was lost in history. We could not restore the ancient music even we had unearthed the original well functional music instruments.

				詩經, traced back around 1100-771BC, originally contained about 3000 chapters, cut down to about 300 by Kongzi during War Dynasty(戰國476&ndash;221 BC).<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The Book Of Classic (尚书), mentioned in other historic books, originally had 3240 chapters, later were cut down to 120 chapters by Kongzi, completely lost during Qin Dynasty (221--207BC), restored during Han (157-87BC), now have only about 29 disputable chapters for today.<br />
				<br />
				According to 《汉书&middot;儒林传&middot;孔安国》(32－92AD). A scholar ZhangBa (张霸) claimed to have full version of Book Of Classic(古文尚书) with 120 chapters inherited from his father and dedicated to Han emperor to spread it out. That book was later considered as fake by other scholars. ZhangBa was put into prison afterwards; the fake book was lost in history.<br />
				<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				周易, dating from 1,000 BCE and before, originally had three versions, lost 2 of them, the remained one is believed modified by Kongzi and others. The standard text originated from the Old Text version (古文經) transmitted by Fei Zhi (费直,&nbsp; 50 BCE-10 CE) of the Han Dynasty, which survived Qin&rsquo;s book-burning. During the Han Dynasty this version competed with the bowdlerised new text (今文經) version transmitted by Tian He at the beginning of the Western Han. However, by the time of the Tang Dynasty the Old Text version became accepted as standard.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>

				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The Bamboo Annals (Chinese: 竹書紀年; pinyin: Zh&uacute;shū J&igrave;ni&aacute;n;), originally interred with King Xiang of Wei (died 296 BC) and re-discovered in 281 AD (Western Jin Dynasty) in the Jizhong discovery, was lost during the Song dynasty (around 960 to 1279), and the partial remained text is known today in two versions, a &quot;current text&quot; of disputed forgery and an incomplete &quot;ancient text&quot;, which is one of primary references book for our OBI dynasty identification study.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				ShanHaiJin (山海经) was mentioned in ShiJi, but its author, date and contents could not be verified. Its version is complicated; there is no any unearthed materials for references. The existing text is believed came from&nbsp; the modified version of west Jin Dynasty of GuoPu (郭璞 276&mdash;324).<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				ShiJi (史記), relatively the most reliable book, written by SiMaqian(135-86BC), total 130 chapters with 10 of them lost and restored by 褚少孙(west Han202BC-9AD), its most parts was considered as the copy usurp of other historic books. Its copied part could be modified by his ruler due to the political need.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Shuowen (Chinese: 說文解字), an early 2nd-century Chinese dictionary from the Han Dynasty edited by XuShen, original text has been lost. The oldest extant trace of it is a six-page manuscript fragment from the Tang Dynasty, amounting to about 2% of the entire text. The fragment, now in Japan, concerns the m&ugrave; (木) section header. During two thousand years of scholars restoration of the damage, the version of (段玉裁) was considered as best and is the one most commonly used by students today.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The book of Daxue (大学) was originally the chapter 42 of LiJi (礼记).</li>
			<li>
				The book of ZhongYong (中庸) was also originated from a chapter of LiJi, and was alleged to be written by Zi Si (子思) of the Warring States Period.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The book of LunYu (论语) considered written by the followers of Kongzi during Waring dynasty (400BC) experienced burning of books during Qin(213BC), restoring during West Han dynasty (西汉228BC--8AD), and the modification during East Hang(东汉25--220), and finally mixed with thoughts of Buda during WeiJin Dynasty (南北朝时代 220--589). The original text was completely unknown.</li>
			<li>
				The book of Mengzi(孟子), collections of thoughts and his speaking, recorded by his followers.&nbsp; The Scholar ZhuJia 朱熹（1130--1200) put all these four books(大学,中庸,论语,孟子) together and called them the four books (四書) which had the profound impact in Chinese history until today.</li>
			<li>
				《甘石星经》，is considered as the earliest astrology and astronomy books in China. It was the combined book 天文星占 written by 甘德 and 天文 written by 石申 during Autumn and Spring and mentioned in ShiJi. However, the book was lost during Song Dynasty. The current version we can read is widely considered as a pure fake book.</li>

				Not only are there so many defects exist on the chinese literature data, but also did there begin to emerge the fake TBI within about 20 years since the discovery of OBI in 1899. As early as in 1919, there began to emerge large amount of fake oracle bones in antique markets. (Anyang LiJi, 1990, p15-16). One of examples was recorded in authorised book JiaGuWenHeJiBuJian (甲骨文合集补编, 作者: 彭邦炯 / 謝濟 / 馬季凡, 出版社: 语文出版社,页数: 108565, ISBN: 9787801264961). Among nearly 28,000 pieces of bones, carefully collected by Liu Tizhi (刘体智1879~1962), now owned and reserved in China State Library in Beijing, there were 112 pieces of bones had been officially identified as forgeries by China Archeology Research Institue(中科院考古所) during 1950&#39;s. The scholar Dong ZuoBing once stated that most of them were fake. (&quot;刘晦之所藏甲骨号称二万片，但大者多是伪刻&quot;).&nbsp; The famous arguable bone, the Si Fang Feng(四方风), which was considered as authentic by famous scholar Hu Hoxun (胡厚宣, 释殷代求年于四方和四方风的祭祀, 复旦学报(人文科学版), 1956-01-31), still remain questionable today. As technologies advanced further, the identification of authentics became more and more difficult.</li>
