			Devolution theory</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Biology Devolution</strong><br />
			<br />
			The term Devolution appeared in biology as early as 19th century during Darwin&#39;s times. It was an opposite theory against Darwin&#39;s evolution. But it was neglected by mainstream. However, it&nbsp; is still valuable for today. Its key points are listed below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The species can change into a more &quot;primitive&quot; simple form rather than advanced complexity. (B&eacute;n&eacute;dict Morel / Lamarckism, 1857)</li>
			<li>
				Contrasting modern humanity to the past,&nbsp; there had been &quot;Morbid deviation from an original type&quot; for mankind. (B&eacute;n&eacute;dict Morel / Lamarckism, 1857)</li>
			<li>
				The species diversity is the result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment, rather than randomly natural selections.&nbsp; (Lamarckism and orthogenesis)</li>
			<li>
				Darwin soothed readers that evolution was progressive, and directed towards human perfectibility. The next generation of biologists were less confident or consoling. Using Darwin&#39;s theory, and many rival biological accounts of development then in circulation, scientists suspected that it was just as possible to devolve, to slip back down the evolutionary scale to prior states of development.(Luckhurst, 2005)</li>
			<li>
				An evolutionary retreat back to a state resembling that from which it began.&quot; (Peter J. Bowler)</li>
			<li>
				The devolution was predetermined by internal factors that organisms can neither control or reverse. (Hyatt )</li>
			<li>
				Complex organs evolve in a lineage over many generations, and once lost they are unlikely to re-evolve. The evolution is not reversible (Dollo&#39;s law)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			As a matter of fact, both evolution and devolution have common ground that they believe that a species can change from one to another due to its accumulated mutation for whatever purpose through over certain amount of time period. Both methods are based upon the observation in our real world existence of variation among same species and similarities among different species. They all ignored the differences between the inheritance and heredities in biology as we discussed in OOA method.</p>
		<p>
			Indeed in OOA method, under particular condition, one type of object can be generated from another different type of object through the downcast operation with data loss at run time space. Under extremely strict condition, with bits operation, it is possible that one type of object can be converted into a brand unknown new type (species) of object. But such process is illegal and will be considered as bugs or virus that my destroy the run-time space system. OOA seems support the devolution theory except that no new species can be created and no linear gradual accumulated mutations ever exist between any two different species in the real world.</p>
		<p>
			From OOA method, in design time space, the relationship between human and ape has only three cases:</p>
		<p>
			See <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_Mankind_Ape.htm">(*)</a></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Human is derived from Ape species:&nbsp;In this case, the baby ape could appear during human reproduction process with downcast technique.&nbsp; It can be used as evidence to support devolution theory.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Ape is derived from Human species:&nbsp;In this case, the baby human could appear during apes reproduction process with downcast technique. It can be used as evidence to support evolution theory.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				Human and Ape are derived from a common pure virtual class (virtual species):&nbsp;The pure virtual class has no any object. In this case, there is no type conversion at all between human and ape.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Human Devolution</strong></p>
		<p>
			Based upon above discuss, this paper proposed the Human Devolution theory -- it means that the human being as a whole has being falling from its original perfect to better, and then to worse state not only in biology (like immune system etc) but also in morals, thoughts, perceptions, etc. The human devolution could be studied from many other different viewpoints, for example, Michael A. Cremo believe that &quot;we do not evolve up from matter but devolve, or come down, from spirit.&quot;[Michael_A_Cremo].<br />
			<br />
			This proposal is consistent to the Genesis account. Since the fall of ancestor, human life span became shorter; human&#39;s living became more and more depend on the materials; human&#39;s moral became worse and worse. Today, human&#39;s health became more and more dependant on its man-made nutrition and well comfort environment; human&#39;s brain became more and more depend on the computer, internet and electronics devices and so on; human became more and more depressed, less and less happiness; human&#39;s happiness became more and more dependant upon the temperay pasive stimulus.</p>
		<p>
			The human&#39;s capabilities of knowing truth have been declining --- there were already no prophecies among human after the end of AD. People became more and more dependent on the science and technologies to predict the future, to perceive the knowledge, or to identify the truth and false. At one hand, people get more and more knowledge about the nature, at the same time, people lost more and more memory about the past. On the other hand, the more human developed, the more the issues they will face. The more knowledge people have, the more destructive power people have. Today, the scientists proudly proclaim that their ancestors were evolved from the apes millions years ago, whereas they completely do not know what their ancestor&#39;s thoughts just thousands year ago. The appearance of evolution theory, the corruption of Catholic, rising of mormonism, the expanding of homosexual marriage, legislation of drug based entertainments, game addictionism, suicide bombing and many things that we can not enumerate are all the result and the evidence of human devolution.<br />
			<br />
			The struggle of falling and anti-falling never stopped all over the human civilization history, but we always failed, like a downtrend stock. The more the human culture developed, the deeper the human fallen into the real world. The emerge of great thoughts in history, like Kongzi, Menzi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, etc, was not the results of human civilization evolution, but the result of human crisis and the strong rebound of extremely pain for their depression and desperation. From this point, Communism was just the rebellious of its falling societies. The emerge of marxism&#39;s revolution theory was just a milestone of human devolution in history.</p>
		<p>
			What people were stuggling hard to work for was not the better life for future, but the more luaxary environments to drive people far away to its original beauty to commit sins. What the impressed and attractive pictures, videos and fancy multimedias or literature demonstrated today were much more happier than what they actually perceived and felt.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Many scholars recently began to view the human history in a devolution way. For example, Patricia published the book -- Questioning Collapse, Human Resilience, Ecological Vulnerability, and the Aftermath of Empire[QuestionCollapse]. Chinse scholars also began to use the devolution ideas to analyze the Chinese cultures[XuLiangGao].&nbsp; No matter how much human devolved, his ruling right over the world never ever been threatened by any other animals -- the fearness came from human itself.</p>
		<p>
			To apply Human Devolution theory into TBI study can help us better understand the Chinese writing etymology, and hence can better objectively understand the origin of Chinese writing to decode TBI.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. Chinese Writing Devolution</strong></p>
		<p>
			Chinese writing system is the only language in the world that continuiously in use till today for more than three thousands years. To compare the very original characters TBI with the modern characters used today, during this long time period, with aboundant un<span style="display: none;"> </span>earthed materials, there is no any solid eveidence to show that Chinese writing system existed a gradual involution process from simple and meaningless to highly intellegent system. On the countary, what the archeological evidences demonstrated was that Chinese writing system gradually became a scattered, broken, mutated, and complicated meaningless system from a perfectly designed integreted object-oriented system after undergoing thansands of years.</p>
		<p>
			See table <a href="./2.___00_Tbl_ChineseCharactersDevolutionProcess.htm">(*)</a></p>
		<p>
			In early twenty century, affected by western cultures, Chinese people tried to make Chinese characters easier to write and learn. After 1956, PRC government gradually rectified more than two thousands simplified characters in mainland China. However, people in other areas failed to accept it. As a result, it causes two different versions of Chinese characters sets to coexist in the world today -- that make Chinese language more confusing and more difficult to learn.</p>
		<p>
			The original purpose of Latinization of Chinese characters sets was to help new learners to remember the pronounciation of each Chinese character[MatteoRicci_Latinization]. However, it caused many scholars to concieve to kill Chinese characters system by replacing it with phonetic Latinos alphabetic system[LuxunWenji][QianXuanTong]. Chinese characters were nearly died in twenty century[ChineseLatinizationPractice][FengZhiWei_HanyuPinyingHistoryReview].</p>
		<p>
			Human devolution and Chinese writing devolution are undividedable.&nbsp;The falling of Chinese writing system is the result of the falling of its language users. The Chinese writing development process in history privides us the solid evidence of the falling of human in history of the world.</p>
