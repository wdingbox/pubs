			Discoveries Inside of TBI</h1>

		<p>
			We found that each character, its writing structure, meaning, and usage, has defined relationships to others. None of the OBI characters is a purely isolated word in the writing system even though they seem to have no direct connection in meaning. To collect all of the internal connections among several thousands of different characters is as complicated as editing of a dictionary. However, we found that there exists a simplicity inside of the whole OBI writing system. Different from an Oxford dictionary that is a book that has no main idea, the OBI writing system appears a hidden central point of ideology through which it can help us to look up all others.  </p><p>

We represent the core thoughts of OBI writing system by discussion of a couple of most critical keywords. Once we uncover the hidden ideas inside of OBI writing system, readers can decode all others with the same integrated method. We found that the OBI dictionary is not necessary needed for us. </p>

			Based on the conclusions and suggestions made from the OBI sampling process analysis, this chapter will further enumerate some typical evidences to support that the core elements of&nbsp; &#39;seven&#39; and &#39;son&#39; in OBI are theologically and ideaoligically the same as the topic what the whole biblical account implied.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			However,&nbsp;the evidences discussed in this chapte are limited in&nbsp;logograms and pictograms inside of the OBI system.</p>
