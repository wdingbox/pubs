			Many chinese scholars believes that people at&nbsp;TBI times&nbsp;were literate in such high degree that large amount of bamboo strips books already existed. &nbsp;The discovery of the only&nbsp;pictogram&nbsp;册 (BOOK) among thousands of&nbsp;TBI&nbsp;was very supportive to this theory.&nbsp;Since the picture&nbsp;demonstrated from the&nbsp;word&nbsp;can well match the images of bamboo&nbsp;strips with texts found in ancient times as early as about 400 BC.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			However, the fact that we could not find any bamboo strips or similar things&nbsp;among large number of&nbsp;unearthed materials along with TBI undermined this theory, although they augued that the bamboo strips were all corrupted and could not last long. As matter of fact, the discovery of the leaves and branches along with Yinxu tomb (<a href="../../">references</a>)&nbsp;told us that if bamboo books&nbsp;were&nbsp;popular at tbi times, we should be able to found them as many as orables bones. In deed, if a book is defined as a collection of words with certain format or grammars, then oracles itself alreay can be considered as book. If the purpose of orcale bones was to cast fortunes,&nbsp;it is hard to explain the relationship between fortuens and books.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			If we look at all friends of this word, we can find specilities&nbsp;about the BOOK.</p>
		<p>
			1) The discovery of <span id="testChar">典</span>, which comes from BOOK, demonstrated that the book is not casual literate book. It is special book refer to a rule, a law, a cannon as what we found. Two hands carefully holding represents the value of book, the respection to the book, the&nbsp;authority of book, the uniquesness of book.</p>
		<p>
			2) Analysis of all freinds of BOOK, we can find that the BOOK is related to speak, son, king, cross, water, mountain, chalic, snake.</p>
		<p>
			3) Due to its specialities, the word book is represented by&nbsp;another word 书 in Today&#39;s simplified words which is wildly used to denot the generic book. Many scholars believe that it is comes from another word in TBI. (in third colum). It means writing down what is spoken.</p>
		<p>
			4) It is not too bold to assert that the four bars represent the four books of gospel. But it is certain that, from the speciality and contents it refered,&nbsp;it can well match gospel. If orinigator can&nbsp;acurate predict&nbsp;content of gospel, why do we deny&nbsp;that the four bars&nbsp;could refer to the four books&nbsp;of the gospel?</p>
