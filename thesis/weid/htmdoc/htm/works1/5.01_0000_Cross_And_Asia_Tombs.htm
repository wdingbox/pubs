			Ya(亚) and Asia Tombs(亚洲墓)</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Brief about Ya</strong>(亚)</p>
		<p>
			After several thousands of years of development, the original character Ya in OBI had been changed to be hardly recognizable in simplified Chinese (Ya,亚). <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_tomb-Ya-etymology.htm">(Ya Etymology)</a>&nbsp; Although it is still in wide use today, its origin and initial meaning has been totally lost.</p>
		<p>
			The earliest and most widely quoted references of this character can be traced back to ShuoWen (XuShen 58-147 AD), where it denoted &#39;Ya&#39; as meaning &#39;second place&#39; in a sequence.&nbsp;[_ShuoWen] Although it did not make sense, it has been widely used in history until today. That&#39;s why a silver medal winner in Olympic games is called Ya-Jun (亚军, second military) in Chinese. </p>
		<p>
			Some scholars believe that this pictograph came from the picture of the legendary ancient fireplace used for primitive, social, vulgar ancestor worship[_ZuoAnming]. The land or continent where such superstitions were practiced was hence called <span><span><span id="ShuoWen">亞</span></span></span>洲 (YaZhou), which we translate as &#39;Asia&#39; in English. However this legendary account cannot be verified.</p>
		<p>
			Some scholars explored this through Chinese culture, philosophy and other viewpoints[_WuQiuye]. However due to its complexity, it still could not be fully clarified so far. This paper will use statistical methods, object-oriented methods and biblical evidence methods to restore its original purpose as well as its religious philosophical motivation.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Ya(亚) and Asia Tombs</strong></p>
		<p>
			If we use the statistic method to analyze the bronze inscriptions at Anyang, we could find that one of the top three most frequently used characters on bronze inscriptions was the character &#39;Ya&#39;. However, its usage frequency is relatively low in bone scripts that were used in temple worship. Since bronzes were buried mainly in tombs, it suggested that this character Ya was connected to the tombs.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Such assumption could further be verified. If we had a bird&#39;s-eye view high above the grand tombs in the Yinxu royal grave garden, we would found that eight out of eleven tombs were structured in the shape of &#39;Ya&#39;.&nbsp;  <a class="filelink" href="./5.___01_Tbl_tomb-pattern-ya.htm">(the bird&#39;s eye view of&nbsp; theYinxu grave garden)</a>,&nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, the archeologist found that the wood coffins buried in tombs 1001,1003,1004,1550&nbsp; were also made in the shape of &#39;Ya&#39;.  <a href="./5.___01____Cross_Shaped_Coffin.htm">(Illustration for M1001 Tomb Coffin)</a> <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_X_Shap_Cross.htm">(X-shape-Cross)</a></p>
		<p>
			This phenomenon emerged at Yinxu Anyang is not coincidence. The &#39;Ya&#39; shaped tombs can be found in various dynasties in China&#39;s history.  <a href="./5.___01___SampleOfTombsWithYaShape.htm">(Sample Of Tombs with Ya Shape)</a> Many scholars had noticed that, from a practical functionality viewpoint, to build one pass road was enough to transport the earth, coffins, bronzes, and so on. It was not necessary to build the pass road as long as about 50-60 meters. For tomb M18 in ZhouGongMiao(周公庙), it was impractical to build three pass roads with 1 meter wide for each[_ZhuLei]. Such &#39;Ya&#39; shaped architecture would make it unnecessarily complicated and inefficient in use[_DuJiuming]. To make a Ya shaped coffin was much more complicated as compared with a regular rectangular shape coffin[_AiLang_Angus]</p>
		<p>
			Obviously the Ya-shapes appeared in tombs were build for religious purposes that have been lost in Chinese history[_WeiJianzhen]. The character &#39;Ya&#39; was a pictogram that came from the structural shape in a tomb or coffin to imply the tomb or death, as well as its associated religious thoughts.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Ya(亚) and Cross(<span class="st">十)</span></strong></p>
		<p>
			<br />
			From an object-oriented viewpoint, we can consider the character &#39;Ya&#39; as a child character of&nbsp; the &#39;Cross&#39;(<span class="st">十)</span> in OBI. In another words, Ya inherited all of its properties from the root of the &#39;cross&#39;(<span class="st">十)</span>. From the viewpoint of drawing art, Ya was just another, more complicated, pictorial format of the simple &#39;cross&#39;(<span class="st">十)</span> symbol.</p>
		<p>
			Hence, if we apply biblical analysis methods, we can clearly see that the connection between Ya and the tomb is the connection between the tomb and &#39;cross&#39;, and the connection between the tomb and &#39;cross&#39; was to connect death to eternal life.</p>
		<p>
			The top three most frequently used characters in bronzes are &#39;Father&#39;, &#39;Ya&#39;, and &#39;Son&#39;. That means the main topic in bronzes was about the&nbsp; &#39;Father&#39;, &#39;Cross&#39;, and the &#39;Son&#39;. Being used with the tomb in a ceremony, they could perfectly express their unspeakable desire and hope for eternal life that Gospels clearly promised later. Here we can clearly see that the characters, the unearthed materials, as well as their religious believes can be well unified biblically.</p>
		<p>
			Due to such deep thoughts rooted on the unspeakable, sub-conscious prediction of the &#39;cross&#39;, &#39;Ya&#39; shape, as a way to express their religion philosophy, was melted in Chinese culture and played important roles for various aspects. For example, as parts of unearthed materials in tombs, there are various cross symbols in bronze (See <a href="./5.___01____Cross_on_bronze_sample.htm">sample of bronzes with cross</a>).</p>
		<p>
			It also affected the building architectures in Chinese history. The Mingtang Piyong (or Ming Hall and Emperor) in Chang&#39;an of the Western Han Dynasty (206BC-8AD) is an example of the early altar temple with the &#39;cross&#39; shape. (See picture: <a href="./5.___01___Cross_in_Buildings.htm">Cross In Altar Temple</a>)</p>
		<p>
			The most miraculous part of the character &#39;Ya&#39; came from its parent character the &#39;Cross&#39;, which was successfully created to antedate the forthcoming symbol and events stated in NT. This will touch another deeper theological areas that the prediction in OT was not unique in the world. The Chinese characters were originally oriented for such prediction purposes similar to the account in OT, although soon after the invention, they were used for other purposes due to the falling and the devolution generation by generation.</p>
		<p>
			China is not the only country famous and rich in the ancient tombs with &#39;Cross&#39; shapes in Asia. If we visit the historic site of Naqsh-e Rustam located about 12 km northwest of Persepolis, in Iran, we can still see the tombs of Darius I (c. 522&ndash;486 BC), Xerxes I (c. 486&ndash;465 BC), Artaxerxes I (c. 465&ndash;424 BC), and Darius II (c. 423&ndash;404 BC). They are all at a considerable height above the ground with &#39;cross&#39; shapes. (See picture: <a href="./5.___01___Tombs_In_Iran.htm">Tombs in Iran</a>).&nbsp; Recently, archeologist found the tomb of Alexander&#39;s father in ancient Greece -- it also had &#39;cross&#39;. (See <a href="../../../../pubdata/pictures/outside-tbi/cross_and_tomb/Philip-II-tomb-o.jpg">picture of Philip-II tomb</a>)&nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			Such connections between the tombs and &#39;cross&#39; shapes, as well as its deep religious thoughts, can also be extended to be found throughout the world in ancient times, though their &#39;cross&#39; styles were different -- in Egypt, it was the ankh(<span style="font-size:24px;">☥</span>), and in the Indus valley, it was the swastika (卐).</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Ya<strong>(亚)</strong> in Bones Inscription</strong></p>
		<p>
			The frequency usage of Ya in bones inscriptions is relatively low as compared with its frequency in bronzes. This indicated that Ya, what it represented in the tomb ceremony, was part of the agenda but not the main topic in temple rituals.</p>
		<p>
			Through our neighbor characters statistics analysis, we can find that Ya in bones inscriptions were surrounded by those like meat(多),&nbsp; horses(馬), birds(隹,雀), swallow(燕), dog(犬), moose(麋),ox,(牛,牢), wild-Swine(彘),Boar(豭), snake(弜), that were used for sacrifice, as well as verbs&nbsp; bless(祝,吉), pray(告,令) and so on, all of which are consistent to the meaning of Ya and its grave ceremony associated. (See table: <a href="./5.___01____Ya_Neighbor_Freq.htm">Neighbor Frequency For Ya</a>) It is similar for us to place the flowers in front of tombs today to express the love, care, hope, blessing, as well as the pray for eternal life.<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			Today, in the West and many other Christian countries, it is a common and natural practice to decorate tombs with cross symbols. (See figures: <a href="./5.___01____western_tomb-with-symbols-cross.htm">cross on Western tombs</a>) This tradition could perfectly match what the Ya(亚) presented at its archeological sites and implied in bones and bronzes inscriptions at Anyang during the Shang dynasty. The significant difference is that such a tradition in China started in far eastern land one thousand and more years earlier than in the western world and remained existence for several thousands of years until recent centuries in China history. It is sad that, as precious ancestral heritage, its origin and religious philosophy were muted or lost, and gradually replaced with Buddhism and other religions or philosophies throughout Chinese history.</p>
		<p>
			We can see that the meaning, usage, and its writing of &#39;Ya&#39; used today are completely different from its original one. It was worse, after the opium war in China in 1840, the character &#39;Ya&#39; was somehow linked to &#39;illness&#39; and &#39;weakness&#39; through the popular idiom 东亚病夫 (DongYaBinFu, East Asia illful master), and became an insulting and shameful word for Chinese people. As a contrast, in the West, almost at the same time&nbsp;in 1850, the&nbsp;red cross emblem, which is essentially the red solid Chinese character &#39;Ya&#39;, was invented by a&nbsp;Swiss man[_JeanHenry] and globally used&nbsp;in hospitals, ambulances and organizations for humanitarian purposes.</p>
