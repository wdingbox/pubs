			The Son And Gospel</h2>

		<h4>
			2) The son, mother and manger</h4>

It is marked as unknown word in TBI until today.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the picture of this word can be&nbsp;perfectly linked to the story in gospel.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>
			&nbsp;</h4>
		<p>
			<img class="m" height="49" jquery1347321546012="247" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/61753.gif" style="width: 38px; height: 44px;" width="41" /></p>
		<p>
			The meaning of this Character in TBI had been lost in history. But the <img class="m" height="29" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/61741.gif" width="36" /> can be traced and recongized to denote a fixed standard &#39;book&#39;, and it is still in use today.</p>
		<p>
			Based on the character of &#39;book&#39; found in TBI, many scholars proposed that there existed books during the TBI times <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Dian3_Book.htm">(PossilbeBambooBooks)</a>. However, this theory could not be supported by archeoligical evidences. Since there was no bamboo or any other types of books ever found at Anyang. Some augued that the books that could not be found was due to the corruptions for long burried time. Whereas archeologist found the leaves along with bronzes -- that belong to the same plant materials as bamboos. The archeological evidence showed that the existance of books at TBI times is less likely.</p>
		<p>
			Further study showed us that TBI was only used for the religious rituals and treated sacred. It was only incrispted on turtle bones with specific meanings or casted on expansive grand bronzes to represent mighty power. The TBI was only used to communicate to heaven, not for people like the books of today.</p>
		<p>
			If there was no books at TBI times, then why did character of &#39;book&#39; was created? and what kind of book was it?&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			In order to explore this, this paper collected all characters in TBI that was composed of &#39;book&#39;. (See table for the list[TBIComposedOfBook]) Through analyize its friends, we can find that the book in TBI was specially related to the &#39;son&#39;, &#39;cross&#39;, &#39;nailed hand and foot&#39;, &#39;ark&#39;, &#39;mountain&#39;, &#39;bloody chalice&#39;, &#39;king&#39;, &#39;altar&#39;, &#39;say&#39; and the &#39;snake&#39; -- all of these words can only be perfectly linked together through the Gospel account.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoint, the character &#39;book&#39; was composed of&nbsp; a circle and four vertical lines. The circle could mean a &#39;nail&#39; or a binding string. In TBI the character with one vertical line, means number &#39;ten&#39;<img class="m" height="22" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/62443.gif" width="22" />, &#39;rod&#39; or &#39;road&#39; etc.&nbsp; The character with two vertical line, some scholars interpreted it as &#39;twenty&#39;<img class="m" height="23" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/62452.gif" width="23" />. It also could be found in compound characters, like,<img class="m" height="21" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/58512.gif" width="21" />,<img class="m" height="22" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/63091.gif" width="22" />&nbsp; The character with three vertical lines did not exist as single character, but could be find in compound characters, like, <img class="m" height="24" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/59978.gif" width="24" />,<img class="m" height="26" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/63366.gif" width="26" />,<img class="m" height="22" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/62445.gif" width="22" />,<img class="m" height="25" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/58676.gif" width="25" />,etc. However, the character with four vertical lines could not be found, not only in individual characters, but also in compund words except the &#39;book&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

			In TBI contents, the nember greater than ten were expressed character by character. The nunber greater than ten expressed by single character could not be confirmed. This paper listed all compound charactes that is possible to express the number greater than ten. However, we could not find rules among them. We have to change the way of visual thinking for these characters.&nbsp; Hence, the four viertical bar in the &#39;book&#39; could only mean the four rolls of books rather than fourty rolls.</p>
		<p>
			As a conclusion, the character &#39;book&#39; in TBI was not the commonly book in general.&nbsp; With the same nature and same number of rolls, the &#39;book&#39; in TBI had to imply the Gospel we have today.</p>
