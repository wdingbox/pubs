		<h3>
			About TBI Inheritance Analysis</h3>
		<p>
			Even after factiong process, the logo roots words are not fully seperated and independent to each other. In stead, they they a kind of relationship among them. thrugh linear analysis, we can find that a root ONE and inheritance relationship among them. There are two types of inheritances, clone and mutation. Virtually all words are inherited from ONE thru clone and mutation.</p>
		<p>
			The inheritance phenomeno, especially the mutation inheritance&nbsp;is so prominent in the two lines group&nbsp; that this branch became the main trunk of tbi root tree.</p>
		<p>
			In the two lines group, except the word TWO, the most freqently used word is the CROSS. there are more things make it special:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				most rich&nbsp;mutation inherited children including logo and picto</li>
			<li>
				SON is one of child of CROSS. and it is a major biggest&nbsp;family of CROSS.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Such&nbsp;close inheritance relationship in writing scripture&nbsp;between the CROSS and&nbsp;SON can lead us&nbsp;to the connection between the tbi creator and the story&nbsp;of&nbsp; gospel in NewTestament. More evidents inside and outside of tbi can prove that this connection&nbsp;is not coincedent. The way that tbi is designed in this way not that way&nbsp;has&nbsp;its unque ultimate prophacy&nbsp;purpose.</p>
