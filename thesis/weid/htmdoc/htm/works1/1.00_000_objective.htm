				The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that the Turtle Bones Inscriptures(TBI) uneathed at Anyang of China today, having been widely considered religous purpose during Shang Dynasty (1500BC),&nbsp;was actually invented to predict&nbsp;their special forthcoming event - the story&nbsp;about the&nbsp;cross&nbsp;that was explicitly stated in Gospels (finished around AD 70) in NT.&nbsp;</p>

				This paper systemically studied the Turtle Bones Inscriptions (TBI) through different scientific methodologies. The results show that all characters in TBI can be integrated into one integrated hierarchy system through OOA method. More important, there exists a main trunk in the whole big tree -- from &#39;one&#39; to &#39;seven&#39;, and from &#39;seven&#39; to &#39;son&#39;. The core elements in this main trunk were not only symbolically but also ideologically and theologically the same as the central topic of the whole biblical account. This paper concluded that the two different, remote, ancient resources were actually talking about the same one topic. For example, the character of cross in TBI not only had the literal meanings of &#39;seven&#39; and &#39;the first of heaven branch&#39;, but also had meanings closely related to the woman, son, nail, hand, foot, crucifixion, worship, human, death, eternal life, etc. Based on the devolution theory -- the original purpose of inventors could be different from their descendant users, the paper further concluded that the very initial created TBI belonged to a kind of prophecy literature similar to that in the OT account rather than the world widely recognized superstitious pyromancy practices. The Genesis messages discovered in Chinese characters could enhance this paper but were not discussed.<br />

				Since the discovery of Turtle Bones Inscriptions (TBI) from Anyang of China in 1899, for more than a century efforts, there are still more than half of characters remain unknown until today. Based on current archeological achievements and traditional methods, for the first time this paper creatively applied various modern scientific methodologies (like stimulus-diffusions, object-oriented, biblical-evidence, visual-thinking, devolution as well as statistic etc.) into TBI study and successfully opened a new window through which we could perceive large amount of new evidences that were ignored for long time. It turned out to be a result that all turtle bone characters were not the plain descriptive language, instead, they were the super intelligent vector set of the prescience of their forthcoming stories which is fully consistent with what the Gospels articulated. With such extraordinary conclusion as presumption, all TBI characters were able to be reunion in one high level object-oriented design system, accordingly nearly all the unknown characters could be naturally decoded consistently.</p>

				Hence the century mysteries in China coulbe be resovled finally.</p>
