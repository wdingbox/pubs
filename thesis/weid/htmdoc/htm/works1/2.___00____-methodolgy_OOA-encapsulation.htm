			<strong>Encapsulation</strong></p>
		<p>
			In English dictionary, encapsulate means to encase in or as if in a capsule. Simply speaking, in OOA, encapsulation means to encase the selected&nbsp;abstracted attributes and behaviours into a secured accessable capsule called &#39;class&#39;. The phrase &quot;secoured accessable&quot; means that certain attribures and behaviours are only allowed to access or utilize under certain rules or conditions. The cases that the attribues and behaviours are not accessible for certain conditions are called infomation hiding. In Java, C++ and ohter computers OOP languages, there defined three layer for security access for atributes and behaviours, that can pretty reflect the nature of world:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				public: No any restriction.</li>
			<li>
				protected: Only owner and its children class&nbsp;can access.</li>
			<li>
				private: None of other classes can access except itself.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			One of important roles for encapsulation is to garantee to keep the object conssistent&nbsp;to its catagolory&nbsp;at run time while&nbsp;being in its unlimited&nbsp;various states&nbsp;througe changes, reproduction or clone in the real world. Encapsulation&nbsp;and inheritance are two ways to make numeriousless objects in difference while keeping similar in the world.</p>
		<p>
			Mendels experiements show us that the changes of traits of plants or insects have extremely strict limitations and rules. For example, the colors of peas are not unlimited, but enumerated in heredity process.&nbsp;The plants&nbsp;may changes its traits within its permitted ranges due to its environments. &nbsp;The plants will die if the environment cause its traits to be changed out of its encapulated ranges.</p>
		<p>
			A human and an ape are objects of two different classes. They are similar because&nbsp;both of them&nbsp;derived from common parents class. However, a human, thrugh heredity and predefined regulated changes in reproduction or clone, can never become an ape unless&nbsp;the encapsulation rules does not exist. So far there is no any archeological discovery, expeirenments evidence that show us one specy can be changed to another specy through its objects clone or reproductions.</p>

			<strong>Chinese Characters Encapsulations </strong></p>
		<p>
			For any human languages inclucing the computer languages,&nbsp;its basic unit&nbsp;is the&nbsp;word. The word can&nbsp;encapsulate either a&nbsp;image/symbol&nbsp;or a&nbsp;sign but not both.&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to two basic types of languages in the world:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Pictographic/Ideogr<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>aphic language:<br />
				Also called ideogram, it is the languages that&nbsp;the word is used as images or symbols to represent an idea or a thing without expressing its pronunciation. For example, Chinese, heiterogrphice and Maya iconic. It is as if in the traffic sign commonly used for &quot;no parking&quot; or &quot;parking prohibited.&quot;.</li>
			<li>
				Alphabetic/phonetic language:<br />
				The alphabetic language is a written human language in which each word is composed of a standard set of character letters called alphabets. Examples are English, Greek, Russian, Thai, Arabic and Hebrew. Each letter is usually&nbsp;associated with a unique distinguished&nbsp;pronounciation. Since the order of letters in a word is consistent to the oder of its pronounciation, so alphbetic languages is also called phonetic languages.That means people can look at a written word and know how to pronounce it. Or people can hear a word and know how to spell it or write it down without knowig the meanings&nbsp;of work.<br />
				&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Archeologies study results show that the earliest human writing&nbsp;are ideographic. Alphbetic/phonetic writing system was developed based on ideographic writing system. Its development process&nbsp;is very similar to the convertion from analog&nbsp;to digital in electronic industry today. This process eventually lead to&nbsp;the&nbsp;invention of&nbsp;the computer scienc as well as the computer software languages, no matter the lowest level like micro computer language or high level scripts like Javascript,&nbsp;which is a&nbsp;copy/paste of&nbsp;human aphabetic languages.</p>
		<p>
			Alphabetic language has only limited small&nbsp;sets characters.&nbsp;But they can make unlimeted numbers of different indexed searchable words as long as human can remember them. Due to alphabets are easy to remember, read and write, alphabetic language&nbsp;were well developed all over the world. According to statistics&nbsp;from writing languages study, since the earliest alpabetic langagues appeared&nbsp;about&nbsp;in&nbsp;27th centuary BC in egyptian, there&nbsp;has been&nbsp;about&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;different alphabetic languages&nbsp;emerged in the world today. Even the Janapnese, which was originated from chinese ideographic, wanted to be converted into pure alphabetic languages.</p>

			Ideographic language, although it is the base of alphabetic languages, since it is difficult to&nbsp;write, no infor for prounciation, developed very slowly with only limited types, including cubinc, hieroglyphic, chinese, mayan iconic etc. and all of them died in the middle of civilication execpt chinese. Two basic features, that make chinese different from other ideographic and make it live in use until today, are&nbsp;crossic and object-oriented.</p>
		<p>
			Chinese writing language is pure object-oiented. The meaning and image are strictly encapulated together&nbsp;in&nbsp;each word.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ecanpsulation feature of OO make it to have overwheemingling advantages&nbsp;over phonetic language and any other ideographic languages.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Dictionary free:<br />
				The encapsulation of meaning and image in chinese word make it Chinese language dictionary free.&nbsp;The real world itself is the dictionary of chinese words. If people forgot the meaning of the word, people can get it back by compare the word to the object in world to get it back. On the contary, in alphabetic language, people can not get the meaning without the its dictionary. Rossetta stone is a sample. The earliest dictionary in chinese history that was called ShuoWen (600AD) was really not necessary and indeed it produced lots of errors and misleading.</li>
			<li>
				Fast reading:<br />
				Chinese word is difficult to write and no clude for pronounciation. But it is easy to read since the form of word, a&nbsp;readily recognizable picture or symbols,&nbsp;can explains everything. Ideographic conveying their visual message directly to our minds, thus bypassing the restrictive intermediary of speech, with human visual thinking, ideas can immediately pop into human minds when seeing them, just like a road stop sign.</li>
			<li>
				Grammar free:<br />
				Since the image and meaning are encapsulated in word, the sequence of words is the sequence of image,&nbsp;which&nbsp;become a vivid moving picture - vedio. So in Chinese&nbsp;writing, there are no significant differences between the&nbsp;word and article. Everything is images or symbols. No grammar is needed. The earliest chinese grammar&nbsp;book, 马氏文通 was written by 马建忠(1844-1900) in 1898, was the results of influence from the western grammars.</li>
			<li>
				Word slip free<br />
				The encapsulation of image and meaning in chinese word ensure that the meaning of the word never changes, even the forms of word is changed. This feature further help the chinees language as dictiory free. As compared with alphabetic language, where the meaning or defination of each word can be arbitary changed, the original meaning of the word could slip away.&nbsp;The original meaning could be tatally lost.&nbsp;</li>

			It is the encapsulation that make each object, after creation by its class, reliable and meaningful&nbsp;like a living person who has personality, thoughts and can talk and smile.</p>
		<p>
			Human know an object through its demonstraed attributes, like color, size, weight, forms etc and its behaviours. Each object identify other objects also bases on its atribures and behaviours.</p>
		<p>
			However, not all infomationn about attributes and behaviours of one object that ohter objects or human being can see or perceive. This is because no tall information is useful or meaningful for others, unnesseccary information could lead to misuse. &nbsp;</p>

			Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class. For this reason, encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding.<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Encapsulation can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class. Access to the data and code is tightly controlled by an interface.<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			The main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code. With this feature Encapsulation gives maintainability, flexibility and extensibility to our code.</p>
		<p>
			In a programming language, encapsulation is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination(1)(2) thereof:<br />
			&nbsp;A language mechanism for restricting access to some of the object&#39;s components.(3)(4)<br />
			&nbsp;A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.(5)(6)<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Some programming language researchers and academics use the first meaning alone or in combination with the second as a distinguishing feature of object oriented programming, while other programming languages which provide lexical closures view encapsulation as a feature of the language orthogonal to object orientation.<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			The second definition is motivated by the fact that in many OOP languages hiding of components is not automatic or can be overridden; thus, information hiding is defined as a separate notion by those who prefer the second definition.</p>
