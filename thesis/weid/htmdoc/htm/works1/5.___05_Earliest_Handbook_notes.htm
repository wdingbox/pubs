		<li>The Pre-existing Handbook of OBI<br>
			<p
				resrc="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Heavenly_Stems_and_Earthly_Branches_Tian/f6caAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=full+unearthed+chinese+oracle+bone+with+heaven-stems&pg=PA19&printsec=frontcover">

				Unearthed inscriptons found on scapulae and tortoise shells verify that certain principles were strictly
				applied into whole OBI writing system everywhere. These priciples are
			<ol>
				<li>predefined numeral system: used for decimal counting for objects or months of a year.</li>
				<li>predefined heavenly-stems system: used for a sacred name or levels in a certains religious kingdom.
				</li>
				<li>predefined earth-branches systesm: used to record the time in a day or the month in a year.</li>
				<li>predefined sexagesimal system: is used to record the years.<br></li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Aarcheologists are disappointed that they could not find any bamboo book or other kinds of scriptures at Yinxu site
				among large amount of the unearthed materials including the clothes, leaves and seeds of wheat. It indicates the
				pre-existed book was designed by allients with another language in another culture different from OBI cullture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A solid evidence
				to prove the possible precursor to OBI is the character Dian <img
					src="http://34.227.20.213/obi/data/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/61741.gif"></img>, which means the
				dictionary, handbook, law, book for today. The characher has four vertical bars, which is equal to
				the number of the principles discovered, can underline the connection.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The character 'Dian' contains a meaning of 'sacred' in OBI, which has been lost today. 
				No any mistakes, misuse, error or exception can be found on any case in OBI among the large number of use cases. For example, numeral system and Heaven-stems are both decimal counting cyclic, but numeral character never ever used with Earth-branch for sexagenary cycling. It shows how careful the priciples are applied into OBI. Also it demonstrated how sacred it is, which is consistent to the meaning of Dian. It is certain that these principles were not formed through long time evolutions but had to pre-exist before OBI can be done. And these priciples are still in use for today, though the characters are altered. It is because the inerrors and aboundant cases that we can easily restore the pre-existed handbook without any trouble. (<a

			</p>
			

		</li>

			<p>
				The precursor's handbook, which has four parts with total 92 characters, is not only the principles for
				counting system, but also the rules of character creation, the purpose of the writings, the
				article of the coorperation.
				It is the key to decode the whole OBI system. Systematic analysis shows
				that the most significant
				abstraction, the most frequently used roots, the main themes as well as the mysteries are mainly in this
				book.
			</p>

			<p>
				With the handbook, readers can freely produce all kinds of characters by inheriting the existing
				characters
				in the book or by abstracting image from the nature as long as they can follow the principles and serve
				the purpose.
				With the book, people can easily appreciate a character if it is good or bad, true or false.
			</p>


			<p>
				Numeral system from one to ten has no zero, which is idential to counting systems in ancient
				Babylonian numbers, Egyptian, Greek and Roman, differs from Roman and Egypt using vertical bars for
				increasing. It undergirds the pre-existed book connecting to foriegners. 
			</p>

			<p>
				From a perspective of objective of the principles and
				sacred meanings of Dian, the four bars could also
				be a mirror predicting the four Gospels
				in NT, though it is possible an accidence.
				Aarcheologists are disappointed that they could not find any bamboo book or other kinds at Yinxu site
				among large amount of the unearthed materials including the leaves and seeds of wheat. It undergirds the
				predictive purpose of the character, which is consistent
				to the predictive purpose of the precursors.

		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Numeral system not only is for counting but also lay down the fundation of writing rules: started with
				horizontal line, produce characters by inheritance and mutations. </p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Heaven-stems and earth-branch manifest the purpose of writing system: describe and predict the advent
				only one with cyclic measurement. According to a legendary matching with Gregorian calendar, the first
				year of sexagenary cycle, which is cross-manger, is 4 AD that is 99.6% accuracy close to the year when
				Jesus was born. (<a

				About the terms (Heaven-Stems 天干 and Earth-Branches 地支): <br>
				The terms emerged in around one millinian AD.


				康熙字典 (清) (1710-1716): 自甲至癸爲天干。《皇极经世》十干，天也。十二支，地也。<a
					href="https://ctext.org/post-han/zhs?searchu=%E5%A4%A9%E5%B9%B2">[-]</a>

				皇极经世书 (宋) (960-1279) by 邵雍 (1012-1077) <a
					href="https://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&res=809496&remap=gb">[-]</a> <br>

				From the origin of the terms, it can be seen that, although the book is used in China all the times, it
				is not recognized as a law with authorities. Its rules are misunderstood and misused in history.


			</p>

			<p>The Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century B.C.E., was the first to teach that
				numbers
				themselves had meaning beyond counting and calculating. Numbers were esoteric symbols with divine
				significance.
				Both Jewish and later Christian readers of the Bible took inspiration from Pythagoras and attempted to
				derive
				mystical meanings from numbers using all manner of creative methods, writes John Davis, author of
				"Biblical
				Numerology: A Basic Study of the Use of Numbers in the Bible."[<a
