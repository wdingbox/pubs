			TBI Consolidation</h3>
		<p>
			The process&nbsp;to consolidate the similar variant characters is called the consolidation process. There are two steps in consolidation process:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Find out&nbsp;all words that have similar writing styles, and put them together into a group.</li>
			<li>
				Choose the most frequently used word in the group as the character to represent that group.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Through consolidation process, we can get about distinct 3809~3948 individual characters from 46,635 variant styles of characters[SongZhenHao]. But this paper will mainly use about 5,450 from about 6,000 characters from Chant.org and Chineseetymology.org.</p>

			Scripture&nbsp;Grouping:During the analysis process, we found that many words its differences in writing are so subtle that we can not found any differences in meaning. Hence we put these&nbsp;very similar words together&nbsp;in one group and choose a commonely used one for their representitive.

				&nbsp;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Meaning Grouping: Different from grouping in writing, we also found some cases that the writing are completely diferent, but they have been intereted as same meaning for scholars. We alos put these words in one group and choose the common one as their representitive.</li>

				In database, we fill out the grouped words with its representitive in&nbsp;column jink.&nbsp;</p>
