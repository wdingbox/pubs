			About Chinese Character Zi (the Son)</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			As compared with the Chinese Cross Character (CCC), the meaning for the Chinese character Zi seemed clear and simple in history -- it means the son, the boy or the male child and used until today. This character frequently appeared in Chinese classical books, especialy during the Autum and Spring Dynasty (around 500 BC), in person&#39;s name -- called Zhu-Zi (ZZ) phenonmenon.</p>
		<p>
			Some scholars has noticed the specilities about the Zi in TBI studies. However, the original intention and the purpose of the creation of Zi in Chinese writing system was never fully clarified so far.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. </strong><strong>Gender </strong><strong>Asymmetric Phenomenon (GAP) </strong></p>
		<p>
			It is common in real world that two things that are same kind of, but both depend on and contradict to each other to form a set. Such kind of two different but related things are usually called a pair, or a couple. All related paired things can be arranged in a definite pattern in a table in form of corresponding parts. Expressed in more math way, it is called symmetric -- when table flips or rotates, the cell can be matched in a pair. Following is an example of symmetric table for paired characters. For TBI, we can find that some characters (1,2,3) are in pair of both in concepts, writings and usages.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Paired_Chars.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			For human being who have same kind of social status, ages or family relationship etc., but with different genders can form a symmetric table for specific languages. For example, in English, there exists individual paired words for each type of persons -- man vs woman, husband vs wife, father vs mother, son vs daughter, boy vs girl, brother vs sister, king vs queen, etc.</p>
		<p>
			However, in Chinese writing system, there are no paired individual characters for son, boy and king, etc. Instead, they use phrases, like, female son, female boy or female king etc. to express the daughter, girl or queen respectively. Following table listed all paired characters in TBI. Obviously in TBI, they are not symmetric.&nbsp;We call this phenonmenon as Gender Asymmetric Phenomenom (GAP) in TBI.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_MF_Asymmetric.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoints, the characters population methods are completely different between the different genders. All characters that represent females were distinguished by the single root pictogram that abstracted from the observation of the image of weman. Whereas for male characters, they were created through aggregation of the root logographs, like cross, nail, hand, rod, king, etc. The distinction is so sharp that they are not compariable to each other. They were generated from different worlds at inital design time. Since very begining, the concepts for persons were asymmetric in Chinse writing language.</p>
		<p>
			Even characters in meaning belong to the the pair of genders, they were not used together in pair in any compound characters in TBI. There were no happy families -- husband-wife, brothers-sisters, or father-mother-son etc. What most frequently appeared in pair in compund character were the &#39;son&#39; and &#39;woman&#39;, and it means good and remained until today [WordFrequenciesInGAP].</p>
		<p>
			The GAP is one of fundmental unique features differentiated from any alphabetic phonetic languages. and the alpabetta languages. However, such difference is not noticable during the litures translation.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. The Son of Man </strong></p>
		<p>
			The GOP show that the character son was not designed in pair in gender -- the son was unique. This feature could be further demonstrated through the characters related to pregnant. Following table listed all characters related to the pregnant.</p>
		<p>
			From items (1,2,3) in table,&nbsp; we can see that the unpaired characters of human and woman had paired characters for human body and pregnant. It clearly showed that the son was not born from the woman only. Other characters related to pregnant also demonstrated that the pregnant in TBI was not based on the female gender. Throguh etymology <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Pregnant.htm">(EtymologyOfPregnant)</a>, we can see that the simplified &#39;pragnant&#39; 孕 used for today came from the pictograms that the son was carried in body of man. Also see <a href="./5.___01_Tbl_TBI_Pregnant_Others.htm">(*)</a></p>
		<p>
			The pictogram of woman with son (3) did not mean &#39;pregnant&#39; in Chinese. Instead, two unrelated compound characters Ren(5) and Chen(6) were widely used to represent female pregnant. Ren shows the work or link between heaven and earth, Chen assembly to the stable related to manger. Ren corresponds to 9 in Hs, Chen to 5 in Eb, and Ren-Chen to 29 in Sx. Refer to <a href="./5.___06_Tbl_system-60-years-Gregorian.htm">table</a>. The connections of Ren and Chen to pregnant was mysterious and lost in history. But at least from these we can see that the pregnant was related to the movement of heaven and earth.</p>
		<p>
			Although the female feature illustrated in the pictogram of woman is weak for preganancy in TBI, it played the significant roles in characters (7,8) to represent the breed and child-care. All of these showed us that the meaning of the &#39;son&#39; in the TBI was far beyond the biological boy that we normally thought in daily life. The son in original Chinese means the unique son of man.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Zi_Pregnant.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. The Son and the Woman</strong></p>
		<p>
			Among all relationships presented throught the aggregation method in TBI, the relationship between son and woman was most prominant.</p>
		<p>
			The RF analysis showed that among all friends of &#39;woman&#39;, &#39;son&#39; has highest frequency. Among all friends of &#39;son&#39;, &#39;woman&#39; has highest frequency. So &#39;son&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; are mutal best freinds in TBI.</p>
		<p>
			The following character in TBI can demonstrated that the woman in TBI was not the regular female person, it was a holy woman.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="https://wdingsoft.github.io/obimg/odb/tbi/img/jgif/57992.gif" /></p>
		<p>
			The GOP discovered in TBI could also be found in Egypt Hierogliphics [TBIAndHierogplyphicsForGood] as well as the oil paintings in Europe, especially during the Renaissance. (See samples of oil paintings[OilPaintingGood]) The character &#39;good&#39; is used every day in our daily life today among Chinese. However, the root reason that &#39;son&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; together were to mean the &#39;good&#39; was lost in history[ShuoWenHao].</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. The Children of the Son</strong></p>
		<p>
			Applying visual thinking method, with different imaginations, we can see muiltiple different images on the same character of &#39;son&#39;, For example,&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				A person with open arms.</li>
			<li>
				A wood cross with a square tag nailed on the top.</li>
			<li>
				A nail and a wood cross.</li>
			<li>
				A pserson with open arms crusified on the wood cross.</li>
			<li>
				A pserson crusified on the cross with a tag over his head. (See picture in following table)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			we can find that the basic imformation the son carried was related to the cross and nail.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Zi_Cross.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Different from the CCC that uses variation and aggregation methods to populate children characters, Zi use variation and polymorphism methods. The polymorphism is important feature in OOA. It provides a single character to represent multiple different meanings, or multiple characters to refer to the same meaning without confliction.</p>
		<p>
			The manger is a polymorphism child of the &#39;son&#39; -- it visually looks like a manger and quite different from the nailed-cross son in image. But it took the first position among the twelve Earthly-branches(Eb), and it means &#39;son&#39; through etymology analysis. (See table)</p>
		<p>
			The character of &#39;manger&#39; in TBI was modified, its original writing and meaning had been fogotten in history. But its two variated children Zhen(贞) and Din(鼎) were actively used in classical books. Today the scholars are still arguing for the confusion existed between them[ZhangJingYu]. In Chinese dictionay, the Zhen could means the &#39;chastity&#39;, &#39;pure&#39;, &#39;virtuous&#39;, &#39;incorruptible&#39;,&#39;dedication&#39;, &#39;devotion&#39;. Din reprents the bronze infering the &#39;King&#39;, &#39;ruler&#39;, &#39;power&#39;, &#39;mighty&#39;. But, with BE method, including the manger itself, all of them were perfectly consistent to the story of the Gospels.</p>
		<p>
			The &#39;Zhen&#39; and &#39;Din&#39; has not significant differences, they have the highest Usage Frequency in TBI. Zhen or Din are the pictogram to represent the bronze vessels. Since Zhen is the child object of manager, so the bronze vessels were to infer the manger. Since manger was to infer the son, so the bronze vessels were created to infer the son -- the ultimate purpose of&nbsp; the bronzes in religions.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Zi_Zhen1.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			So any characters in TBI that visually assembly to manger can be the polymorphism child of son. (See following)</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Zi_Manger.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The son also has meaning of snake. Polymorphism is powerful, but it was also confusing if people did not have the original design documents.</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Zi_Snake.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			In family of &#39;son&#39;, there were three characters used in heaven-stems and earth-stems. (See table of counting system)&nbsp; This is the evidence demonstrated that the &#39;son&#39; were closely related to heaven, earth and the laws of universe which is what the Gospel meaned to.</p>
		<p>
			Through GCF analysis of the son&#39;s family, its results show that the featured root characters contains the information like crown of throne, hang, raise-up, bent, pressure etc. that enriched the meaning of the &#39;son&#39; in TBI that can be linked to Gospel account. (see table below)</p>
		<p>
			From OOA viewpoints, we can find that the family of &#39;son&#39; is the biggest one among the children of &#39;seven&#39;. Nearly 7% of all root characters belongs to the children of &#39;son&#39;. Nearly 4% compound words are composed of the son&#39;s family.<br />
			&nbsp;</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Zi_Family.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		See <a href="./4.__02_1000_Zi_CGF_Results.htm">(*)</a>.
		<p>
			Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The total number of factored elements is about 17.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
				The number of possible types of&nbsp; variations of &#39;son&#39; is 7x5x5=175. We only list about 40.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>6. Conclusion</strong></p>
		<p>
			What the &#39;son&#39; implied in meamings from both the character itself and its family are all the same as what the Gospel delivered.</p>
		<p>
			From GAP, we can concluded that,&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				the &#39;son&#39; in TBI was not just the biological son --he was a special son-of-man;</li>
			<li>
				the woman was not regular flesh woman -- she was associated with the&nbsp; &#39;stables&#39; and &#39;work&#39; between heaven and earth, the virgin&#39;s breed, etc.</li>
			<li>
				the frequently appeared relationship between the son and woman was not regular relationship between mother and son.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			All of the specialites in GAP showed the features idential to what the Gospel stated.</p>
