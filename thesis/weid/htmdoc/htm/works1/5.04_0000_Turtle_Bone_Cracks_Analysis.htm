			Turtle Bones Crack Analysis</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Background</strong><br />
			<br />
			The oracle bones (mainly including ox scapulae or turtle plastrons unearthed at Anyang) were&nbsp;widely considered to be used for pyromancy <span data-dobid="hdw">superstition&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&ndash; a form of divination &ndash; in ancient China during the late Shang dynasty. Such theory believe that the inscriptions carved onto the oracle bones were questions to deities regarding future weather, crop planting, the fortunes of members of the royal family, military endeavors, and other similar topics. In order to get the answers of uncertainties of futures, intense heat metal rod were applied into the oracles bones&nbsp;to&nbsp;cause the crack due to thermal expansion.&nbsp; Then the special diviner would&nbsp; interpret the pattern of cracks into answer of &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; in order to guide human&#39;s decisions and write the prognostication upon the piece as well. This religious superstitions process is called Bu or JanBu (占卜, 龟卜, 算命卜卦 ) in Chinese. Bu(卜) means:&nbsp; forecast by divination through turtle, to divine / to consult the oracle / to foretell / to predict / to choose / to select.&nbsp; The divination is to foretell future event or discover hidden knowledge by occult or supernatural means.</p>
		<p>
			Today almost all scholars unamically agree with such kind of theory[CuiBo]&nbsp;since it has been confirmed&nbsp;through&nbsp;EZ anaylysis method with large mount of unearthed broken or craked oracle bones, as well as &nbsp;large mount of similar accounts consistently found&nbsp;in many&nbsp;different ancient Chinese history books including ShangShu, YiJing, LiYi, ChunQiuZuoZhuan, ShiJi etc. (see table: <a href="./5.___04__Tbl-Bu-In-Classic-Books.htm">Bu卜 In Chinese Ancient Books</a> )&nbsp;about events and stories of how&nbsp;ancient people&#39;s decision were deteremined through oracle bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in ChunQiuZuoZhuan, &quot;卜以决疑，不疑何卜&quot; (To practice Bu in order&nbsp;to determine the uncertainties of future. Why do it if no such issues.);&nbsp; 龟兆告吉 (turtle crack fortell luck.) In Shuwen, Bu is a considered as pictogram that reflect the image of crack of turtle bone.&nbsp; &ldquo;灼剝龜也象灸龜之形一曰象龜兆之從橫也凡卜之屬皆從卜&rdquo;</p>
		<p>
			However, such theory contains many issues that could not be&nbsp;resolved and we could not found answers for these issues from Chinese historic books. For example, how did the diviners fortell the&nbsp;event based on the pattern of cracks and inscriptions?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it real reliable? If it is just the&nbsp;foolish psychological comforts or pure religious superstitions cheat, why did they continioulsy and extenensively practice it for several hundreds of years in Shang dynasty? This paper provide a different&nbsp;theory about the role of oracle bones&nbsp;in Shang dynasty&nbsp;by examination and analyzing its manufacturing produce process.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Life Cycle of Turtle Bones</strong></p>
		<p>
			Based on observation of oracle bones unearthed at Anyang, many Chinese scholars proposed a six-steps manufacturing process hypothesis[XuJingXiong].&nbsp;We adopted this&nbsp;analysis methods&nbsp;and put the&nbsp;6-steps manufacturing processes&nbsp;into a table to faciliate our study.&nbsp;See Table:&nbsp; <a href="./5.___04__Tbl-Bu-In-Tbl-TBI-CDB.htm">6-Steps Manufacturing Process</a>.</p>
		<p>
			For&nbsp;all possible sequences for manufacturing steps in a work flow, the permutation is P(6,6)=720.&nbsp;&nbsp;For simlicity, we start with uninary relationship analysis, its combinations is&nbsp;C(6,2)=15. Since P is always the first step, T is always the last step, so&nbsp;the combination&nbsp;becomes C(4,2)=6. The these 6 reasoning process and results are&nbsp;put in&nbsp;table. (see table: <a href="./5.___04__Tbl-Bu-In-Tbl-TBI-CDB.htm">Uniary Relationships Analysis Steps</a> )</p>
		<p>
			With reasoning results from uniary analysis, we can further conclude that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				From 2, we&nbsp;find that &nbsp;C and D do not depend on each other on process steps. But they located side by side if both appear.</li>
			<li>
				From 2, 3 and 4, If C, D, B appear at the same time, C and D are always burnt by B.&nbsp; So CDB are bindled together, has closer space relationship and CD happens before B in time.</li>
			<li>
				Athough I has no direct relationship with CDB in location (from 5,6),&nbsp; I alway happens before B (from 3,4). Hence we got sequnce ICDB.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Finally, we got a conclusion that the most possible whole 6-steps manufacturing production work flow sequence is:&nbsp; PICDBT.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. The Crack of Turtle Bones</strong></p>
		<p>
			Many scholars believe that the purpose of Chisel and Drill is to help to crack the oracle bones during the burning process. However,&nbsp;through following analysis, we can find different theory for them.</p>
		<p>
			From 6-steps manufacturing processes analysis result -- PI<strong>CDB</strong>T, we found that following three important man-made marks on the bones were always closely made together and they followed a certain sequence of order in process:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				C: long deep ditch (possibly made by chisels, 凿 Zao)</li>
			<li>
				D: circular shallow hollows (possibly made by drills, 钻Zuan)</li>
			<li>
				B: yellow scorch and black burns (possibley due to the hot burn, 灼Zhuo)</li>
		</ol>
		<div>
			In addition, from some of the unearthed whole plastrons, we found that,</div>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The chisels are neatly arranged line by lines in matrix. In plastron, they arranged in a symmetric way of center line.</li>
			<li>
				The density varies bone by bone. Some bones contain 300 chisels within 20x20 cm squares.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			We also find many unearthed well reserved full plastrons with inscriptions, chised, drilled and burned that have no cracks. The turtle bone is not easy to crack. It is strong in tensile (about 130Mpa) and has certain elasticity (about 41-68Mpa).&nbsp;Aplying&nbsp;chise, drill and burn on bones&nbsp;could hardly&nbsp;cause visible crack (see <a href="./5.___04__Turtle_Bone_Burn_Marks_Reproduction.htm">Burn Mark Reproduction Report</a>). The fractures usually occur when bone cannot withstand those outside extremely strong forces applied to it. So far, we have not find any relationship between crack and burn, chisle and drills. We could find the burn marks pattern, but there was no crack battern at all that we could find.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4.&nbsp; Incense Burning on Turtle Bones </strong></p>
		<p>
			The use of incense was one of most common and important features in worship ritual in all the ancient world. Burning incense was mentioned for more than a hundred of times in OT and NT.&nbsp; The incense was a kind of aromatic biotic material. According to Exod 30:34-35, the incense was made from fine powder of gum resin, onycha, galbanun, pure frankincense and mineral salts. So it is hard to be reserved under burried wet ground for long&nbsp;time. That&nbsp;could be the main&nbsp;reason there was no reports regarding about the discovery of&nbsp;the ancient incense.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			When burned, the incense&nbsp;releases fragrant smoke and turned into white&nbsp;grey ash. At archeological site of Anyang where the oracle bones were unearthed, we have found many deep ash pits, like&nbsp;YH127 in 1993. About&nbsp;300 pieces of well reserved full size inscribed plastrons were found in H3 ash pit in 1991.[WeiCiDe]&nbsp;Since we could not find that any roles the ash pits&nbsp;could play&nbsp;under the ground, it suggested us that&nbsp;the ash pits were the by-products of burned incense. (It will still need chemical verification.)</p>
		<p>
			Based on large mount of observation on burn marks on the unearthed oracle bones, we found that they&nbsp;have following characteristics:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Burn mark area ranges variously on same bones from 0.2 cm to 3.0 cm even on a same bone.</li>
			<li>
				The surface of burn mark is not smooth. Some of them seems like attached. (refer to report)</li>
			<li>
				The chisel side seldom is burned.</li>
			<li>
				The black burn is surrounded by a circle with bright yellow scorch.</li>
			<li>
				the chiseled ditch is like a firewall -- one side is burned, the other side not.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			However, it was very difficult for us to reproduce above burn mark by applying intense heat metal rod&nbsp;on it. Whereas, all above features of burn mark can be easily reproduced through buring incense. Especially during the burning process, we found that it is the resin in the incense that causes the bright yellow scorch around the black mark. (see <a href="./5.___04__Turtle_Bone_Burn_Marks_Reproduction.htm">Burn Mark Reproduction Report</a>)&nbsp; Such experiement proved that the burn mark on oracle bones was caused by burning incense rather than hot metal rod. This discovery drove us to re-think about the role of&nbsp;oracle bones in Shang Dynasty. The burn applied on bones is not to intended to produce cracks, but the results of consuming of incense.The marks of chisel and drill were not to make the crack patterns, but to support to erect the incense.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. Analysis</strong></p>
		<p>
			Many scholars consider the text inscripted on oracle bones as yes/no interrogative sentences with question mark. As matter of facts, we could not find question marks or any other punctuation marks at all on any oracle bones, nor could we find any solid patterns to indicate any contents as interrogative sentences. At least, through the grammar analysis, Li XueQing, and some other scholars suggested that not all the centences in TBI are questionary for divination. How to divide a long string of characters into groups or sentences still need to further explore. It is not correct to add any additional marks or remove any marks during the study of oracle bones inscritions.</p>
		<p>
			The sentences found in full size oracle bones are all very short and simple. Due to the limited writable area of oracle bone, the number of characters for each full length text on oracle bones are very limited. There is no compound sentences or interrogative sentence needed within such limited&nbsp;number of characters.&nbsp; The full text we found usually started with date; they were more like a simple dairy or journel log -- simple declarative statement.</p>
		<p>
			Although the meaning of a sentence is different from the meaning of each characters, they are closely related. Among all characters in oracle bones, the correct understanding of character Bu is most critical in OBI study, since, it is the second most freqently used key charcters in OBI (38476, f=6.3%); it appeared in every full size bones; it could be the representative of whole obi, as well as the whole rituals along with it.</p>
		<p>
			Bu was always followed by, in the same sentence, most frequently used character Zhen ( f=7% ), a pictogram that was consistent to the pictures of large amount of unearthed bronze vessels that was primarily used to sacrifice sheep, ox, birds or to burn perfume to worship Heaven. The charater Zhen denotes: chastity of a woman / pure / virtuous / to be incorruptible / to be correctly firm / devotion / dedication. The character Zhen freqently used on bronzes. The word Zhen played the role of&nbsp; &#39;adoration and praise of god&#39; in meaning; corespondingly, as a couple of pairs in the same sentence, it was natural for Bu to <span>imply to address a <span>formal and dignified </span>request to god</span> -- that played the role of &#39;expecting and geting from god&#39;.</p>
		<p>
			The characters did not appeared anywhere at Shang, but only writen on expansively manufactured oracle bones and bronzes. This&nbsp; demonstrated the characters were treated so sacred as the incense used in the rituals.&nbsp; The meaning of characters were as serious as the whole rituals.</p>
		<p>
			However, with devolution theory, generation by generation, as the falling went further, the original god that they worshiped became more and more faded in heart; the ritual activities became more and more dull and superficial in stylish; people became more and more concetrated on result of &quot;expection and gettings&quot;. They had more and more desires and filled in with more and more&nbsp;requests like expected weather, farming harvest, military wars, defeating of enemies, political power etc. Gradully the original purpose of ritual, the original meaning of of characters,&nbsp; original intentions of invention writing system, were all lost and fogotten; Eventually the ritual activities turned into cult practice; the oracle bones, its inscriptions and the meaning of the Bu became the feature and representitive of superstitions.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; final results were passed down to decents, recorded in earliest books and maintained until today.</p>
		<p>
			It is too coarse and reckless for us to simply think that character Bu as well as oracle bones just as &quot;superstitions&quot;. Shang as a dynasty, its society unity and prosperity had lasted for about several hundreds of years. To overview all of unearthed discoveries in Anyang,&nbsp; including bronze vessals, bronze music instruments, choit, weapons,&nbsp; mension building, grand temples, the cross format of tombs, as well as the origin of characters, object-oriented characters system, matured calender used, and so on, we have to admit that they had high intelligence, advanced technologies and thoughts that were far beyond our imagination.</p>
		<p>
			The later compund character of&nbsp; Bu (訃,讣), which was not found in OTI but appeared in one of ealiest history books LiJi (礼记, 杂记上第二十, 西汉 West Hang Dynasty 206BC - 9AD ), means obituary (讣告, 讣帖, 报丧的帖子), that is different from the meaning of &#39;superstitious foretell&quot; and was formally used until today. This seems to be consistent to the meaning of compound word of Bu in OBI that is related to the &quot;burrials&quot;. This could shed some light that original Bu on OBI had other meaning rather than what we defined today the meaning of &quot;superstitious foretelling&quot;.</p>
		<p>
			Oracle bones and bronzes, the only media carrying the earliest chinese characters, could be considered as the careful and serious birthplace of chinese writing system. In other words, chinese characters and writings were the by-products of their religion. No religions, no writings. Here we can see that, from the beginning, Chinese culture and literature were the mixture of evils and rightiousness and that the mysteries and confusions domained the history and kept until today.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>6. Conclusions</strong></p>
		<p>
			Through the burn mark reproduction labatory experiments, logical reasoning and overall analysis, we could not find the internal relationshipe among the burns, cracks and inscriptions -- the burn marks were caused by incense burning; the ditches and hollows on the bones were used to hold the incenses; the cracks were caused by long time burries; the inscripitions were originally used for communication to heaven in worship. The oracle bones, that provided the central plateforms to execise such religious&nbsp;ceremony, originally were used for the worship but lately considered as the purpose&nbsp;for&nbsp;the divination in history. From worship to&nbsp;fortune foretelling,&nbsp;it&nbsp;demonstrated the evidence of human devolution process. To simply define OBI as <span data-dobid="hdw">superstious </span>pyromancy <span data-dobid="hdw">could not accurate reflect its whole original essence.</span></p>
