			Human Body Part In TBI</h3>
		<p>
			All word used to descript the human being body parts&nbsp;are listed in table. From the table we can find that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Logograms are used to denote body parts.</li>
			<li>
				Pictograms that is used to denotes body parts for human being can also match to animal.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Using drawing techniqe that is used for TBI, it is not hard to create a set of simple pictures to specially denote the human being&#39;s body part. <img alt="sad" height="20" src="../../../../oojs/html-editor/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sad_smile.gif" title="sad" width="20" /><img alt="laugh" height="20" src="../../../../oojs/html-editor/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/teeth_smile.gif" title="laugh" width="20" />&nbsp;However, the words that we saw are strange. This told us that the body part that is used in TBI are not fully the biological body parts for human.</p>
