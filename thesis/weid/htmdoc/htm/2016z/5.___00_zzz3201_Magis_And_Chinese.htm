				A lost Syriac manuscript, the Revelation of the Magi, recently translated into English by Bible scholar Brent Landau, may help answer that key question from the Christmas story: &ldquo;Who were the magi?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Who were the magi, those gift-bearing wise men from the east who are so central to the traditional telling of the Christmas story? Bible scholar Brent Landau believes he has found at least one answer to this age-old question.</p>
		<p>
			The Bible tells us very little about the magi. Their story appears but once, in the Gospel of Matthew (2:1&ndash;12), where they are described as mysterious visitors &ldquo;from the east&rdquo; who come to Jerusalem looking for the child whose star they observed &ldquo;at its rising.&rdquo; After meeting with King Herod, who feigns an intention to worship the child but actually plans to destroy him, the magi follow the same star to Bethlehem. There, upon seeing the baby Jesus and his mother Mary, the magi kneel down and worship him, presenting him with their three famous gifts&mdash;gold, frankincense and myrrh. Then, without reporting to Herod, they depart for their homeland, never to be heard from again.</p>
		<p>
			For early Christians, the seemingly pivotal yet unexplained background of the mysterious magi provided abundant room to shape new narratives around the question, &ldquo;Who were the magi?&rdquo; One of the most compelling, recently translated into English by Brent Landau, professor of religious studies at the University of Oklahoma, is the so-called Revelation of the Magi, an apocryphal account of the traditional Christmas story that purports to have been written by the magi themselves.</p>
		<p>
			The account is preserved in an eighth-century C.E. Syriac manuscript held in the Vatican Library, although Brent Landau believes the earliest versions of the text may have been written as early as the mid-second century, less than a hundred years after Matthew&rsquo;s gospel was composed. Written in the first person, the Revelation of the Magi narrates the mystical origins of the magi, their miraculous encounter with the luminous star and their equally miraculous journey to Bethlehem to worship the child. The magi then return home and preach the Christian faith to their brethren, ultimately being baptized by the apostle Thomas.</p>

			<span style="background-color: #ffff00">According to Brent Landau</span>, this dramatic account not only answers the question &ldquo;Who were the magi?&rdquo; but also provides details about how many they were, where they came from and their mysterious encounter with the star that led them to Bethlehem. In the Revelation of the Magi, there are not just three magi, as often depicted in early Christian art (actually, Matthew does not tell us how many there were), nor are they Babylonian astrologers or Persian Zoroastrians, as other early traditions held. Rather from Brent Landau&rsquo;s translation it is clear the magi (defined in this text as those who &ldquo;<span style="background-color: #ffff00">pray in silence</span>&rdquo;) <span style="background-color: #ffff00">are a group&mdash;numbering as few as 12 and as many as several score&mdash;of monk-like mystics from a far-off, mythical land called Shir, possibly China.</span> They are descendants of <span style="background-color: #ffff00">Seth</span>, the righteous third son of Adam, and the guardians of an age-old prophecy that a<span style="background-color: #ffff00"> star of indescribable brightness would someday appear &ldquo;heralding the birth of God in human form</span>.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>
			When the long-prophesied star finally appears, the star is not simply sighted at its rising, as described in Matthew, but rather descends to earth, ultimately transforming into a luminous &ldquo;star-child&rdquo; that instructs the magi to travel to Bethlehem to witness its birth in human form. The star then guides the magi along their journey, miraculously clearing their path of all obstacles and providing them with unlimited stamina and provisions. Finally, inside a cave on the outskirts of Bethlehem, the star reappears to the magi as a luminous human child&mdash;the Christ child&mdash;and commissions them to become witnesses to Christ in the lands of the east.</p>
		<p>
			It&rsquo;s a fascinating story, but does it actually bring us any closer to understanding who the actual magi of the Christmas story might have been? Unfortunately, the answer is no, says Landau, although it may provide insight into the beliefs of an otherwise unknown Christian sect of the second century that identified with the mysterious magi.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;Sadly, I don&rsquo;t think this is actually written by the historical wise men,&rdquo; said Landau in an interview with National Public Radio&rsquo;s Diane Rehm. &ldquo;In terms of who wrote it, we have no idea. [But] the description of the magi and [their religious practices] is so remarkably detailed and I&rsquo;ve often wondered whether it&rsquo;s reflecting some actual community out there that practiced and kind of envisioned themselves in the role of the magi.&rdquo;</p>

			<span>Frankincense</span></h1>
		<p>
			Frankincense is tapped from the scraggly but hardy trees by slashing the bark, which is called striping, and allowing the exuded resin to bleed out and harden. These hardened resins are called tears. The aroma from these tears are more valuable for their presumed healing abilities and are also said to have superior qualities <span style="background-color: #ffff00">for religious ritual</span>.</p>

		<p>
			In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine" title="Traditional Chinese medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a>, myrrh is classified as bitter and spicy, with a neutral temperature. It is said to have special efficacy on the heart, liver, and spleen meridians, as well as &quot;blood-moving&quot; powers to purge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_stasis" title="Blood stasis">stagnant blood</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus" title="Uterus">uterus</a>. It is therefore recommended for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism" title="Rheumatism">rheumatic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis" title="Arthritis">arthritic</a>, and circulatory problems, and for <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenorrhea" title="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmenorrhea" title="Dysmenorrhea">dysmenorrhea</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause" title="Menopause">menopause</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus" title="Uterus">uterine</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor" title="Tumor">tumors</a>.</p>

			Myrrh&#39;s uses are similar to those of frankincense, with which it is often combined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction" title="Decoction">decoctions</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liniment" title="Liniment">liniments</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incense" title="Incense">incense</a>.

			The story of the Three Wise Men is one of the most familiar and beloved parts of the Christmas story. But for all of their popularity, the mysterious travelers from the East &mdash; known as the Magi &mdash; appear in only one short passage in the New Testament, following a star to the site of Jesus&#39; birth and bringing gifts of gold, francincense and myrrh. Many religious scholars aren&#39;t even sure they really existed.</div>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Now, a first-ever English translation and detailed analysis of a little-known eighth-century manuscript of a story probably written in the second or third century uncovers a far more substantial version of the wise men story.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Brent Landau, a professor of religious studies at the <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Organizations/Schools/University+of+Oklahoma" title="More news, photos about University of Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> and an expert in ancient biblical languages, found references to a text about the wise men in writings from the <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Middle+Ages" title="More news, photos about Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and learned that a collector in the 18th century had discovered in a Turkish monastery a manuscript called &quot;the Revelation of the Magi&quot; with a narrative about the wise men. He gave it to the <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Vatican+Library" title="More news, photos about Vatican Library">Vatican Library</a>, where the document, written on vellum, a type of parchment made of animal skin, remains archived away in virtual obscurity.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			As part of his doctoral dissertation at <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Harvard+Divinity+School" title="More news, photos about Harvard Divinity School">Harvard Divinity School</a>, Landau spent seven years translating and analyzing the text, written in Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic used by early Christians throughout the Middle East and Asia &mdash; and which he happened to be studying. He worked from both a 1927 published text in Syriac and the original document at the Vatican.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Landau&#39;s book, <i>Revelation of the Magi: The Lost Tale of the Wise Men&#39;s Journey to Bethlehem</i> (HarperOne) describes the Magi as an ancient mystical sect descended from Seth, the pious and virtuous third son of Adam and Eve. From Seth they inherited a prophecy of &quot;a star of indescribable brightness&quot; someday appearing and &quot;heralding the birth of God in human form.&quot; This same star had initially hovered over the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden.</p>
		<div id="tagCrumbs">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Among the book&#39;s other revelations:</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			&bull;The Magi are described as coming from a land called Shir, &quot;located in the extreme east of the world, at the shore of the Great Ocean.&quot; In other ancient texts, Shir is referred to &quot;as a place where silk comes from,&quot; says Landau, suggesting that the references were to China.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			&bull;In Syriac, the word Magi means &quot;to pray in silence.&quot; Landau says it has no relationship to magicians or astrologers, sometimes cited in stories today.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			&bull;The text names 12 Magi, not three, while other parts of the text suggest that &quot;a group the size of a small army&quot; traveled to Bethlehem, says Landau.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Other religion scholars who reviewed Landau&#39;s work recognize the unique interest the wise men narrative holds.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Of the many early Christian documents recently discovered, <i>Magi </i>&quot;is by far the most fascinating,&quot; writes <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/John+Dominic+Crossan" title="More news, photos about John Dominic Crossan">John Dominic Crossan</a>, professor emeritus at <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Organizations/Schools/DePaul+University" title="More news, photos about DePaul University">DePaul University</a>, in a comment on the book&#39;s back cover.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			&quot;Landau is to be congratulated for bringing this important and unexpectedly influential work to light,&quot; adds Jennifer Knust of <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Organizations/Schools/Boston+University" title="More news, photos about Boston University">Boston University</a> School of Theology, in another comment.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Although the text claims to be personal testimony, &quot;it seems unlikely that it could have been written by the Magi themselves,&quot; Landau says. He cites a number of anachronisms, such as references to Christian writings recorded years after Jesus&#39; death.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Who then wrote the wise men story?</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			&quot;One guess,&quot; says Landau, &quot;is some kind of religious community of Christian mystics.&quot;</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			The fact that the Magi are described as standing for days at a time on top of a sacred mountain, visiting a purifying spring, and seeing visions after eating certain foods could suggest that this was a way for a community to talk about itself and give it some authority by putting it in the mouths of the Magi, he says.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			In addition to offering a detailed account of the life and background of the wise men, the text sheds some light on how some early Christians experienced Christ, Landau says.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			When they first encounter the long-prophesied star, the text says it initially appears in a celestial form that then transforms into a human form or &quot;star child,&quot; who instructs them to go to Bethlehem to witness its birth. Each of the Magi, in fact, sees the star child in a different form, with each vision representing a different time in the life of Christ. Nowhere in the text is the name <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Religion+and+beliefs/God,+Saints,+Prophets/Jesus" title="More news, photos about Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> used to designate the Magis&#39; celestial guide, suggesting that they experienced Christ and became followers without ever knowing the savior figure by that name, Landau says.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			This speaks to the &quot;universality of Christ&#39;s revelation,&quot; says Landau, an Episcopalian.</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			What should everyday readers take from this retelling, especially during the Christmas season?</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			An appreciation for the &quot;imaginative way in which early Christians engaged&quot; the story of the wise men to make it their own, says Knust. They &quot;loved this story enough to write this version.&quot;</p>
		<p class="inside-copy">
			Christians carry on that same tradition today, whether through Christmas pageants, or songs, or art. &quot;We continue to re-imagine the significance of the Christmas story in a way that is meaningful to the people,&quot; she says.</p>
