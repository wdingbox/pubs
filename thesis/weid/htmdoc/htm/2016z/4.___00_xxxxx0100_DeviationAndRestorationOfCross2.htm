			The Cross Deviation and Restoration</p>
		<p>
			CROSS is one of the oldest scripts that is still in use for today. <a href="./7.___01_Tbl-Scriptures-Used-Until-Today.htm?rrfid=20120908_065806">(*)</a>. However the meaning of CROSS that is used for today in Chinese&nbsp;is completely different from the TBI times. The etymology show us the change process of CROSS <a href="./7.___01_Tbl-Word-Deviation-Exchange.htm">(*)</a>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Today whenever people saw the CROSS, the first mind that Chinese people will come up is&nbsp;just a number ten without other&nbsp;meaning. But in TBI times, the CROSS has two meanings.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				the number seven (see <a href="./Tbl-Numeric-Words-Comperison.htm">table&nbsp;</a>)</li>
			<li>
				the first of heaven-sterm (see <a href="./Tbl-Date-Time-Expression-Method.htm">table </a>)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			One word denotes two completely different meaning which is&nbsp;nearly conflicting to each other.&nbsp; This is a very special case that exist in TBI. The actual meaning of CROSS at TBI times is determined by the content or&nbsp;group it was used together. Why not to use two different symbols to represent two different words with different meaning to simply the reading and writing?&nbsp; There are tons of free symbols&nbsp;to pick up or define at that times.</p>
		<p>
			This phenomeno certainly would cause&nbsp;the different opions. The&nbsp;different opinions eventually&nbsp;led to long time&nbsp;fighting&nbsp;between the &#39;deviation&#39; and &#39;resotration&#39;, which can be clearly seen in&nbsp;etymology&nbsp;during the following dynasty of Zhou&nbsp;in 800 years.</p>
		<p>
			The results of battle is out of what we expected. The number ten involved in and take away&nbsp;the symbol of the CROSS. The original symbol for both&nbsp;number 7 and the&nbsp;first of&nbsp;heaven-stem&nbsp;was changed&nbsp;to the state as we use today.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			It is easy for us to stand on the side of those who want to make change. But&nbsp;what is the designer&#39;s thoughts?&nbsp; We can not get answer if we apply EZ methods. However, if we apply BE method, the answer is completely satsifying. In bible, the seven, the cross, the son, the beginning, and the ending, they all imply the same&nbsp;thing the heaven, the GOD.&nbsp;More evdences will prove that such literate meaning of the CROSS in tbi design, has&nbsp;same purpose to imply the GOD used in bible.</p>
