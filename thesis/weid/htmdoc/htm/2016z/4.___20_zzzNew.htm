		<h3>
			Human Being In TBI</h3>
		<p>
			All word used to descript the human being is listed in table. From the table we can find that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The front view of human being, which we think that is most similar to human outlok, is not used to represent human. Instead, they represent king, heaven, master etc.</li>
			<li>
				The side view of human being with worship style on the kneel is&nbsp;used to denote human being.</li>
			<li>
				The side view of lower part and front view of upper part of femal are combined together&nbsp;in one picture and&nbsp;they&nbsp;are used to represent femal person. The one with nipples are used to represent mother. The one without nipple should represent the virgin.</li>
			<li>
				Father, son and human male are denoted by logograms with cross.</li>
			<li>
				The side view of human being without worship style, but looks like a snake, is used to represent corpse or dead person.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			We can further find that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Father and mother&nbsp;are completely different in the way to express in TBI.&nbsp;One is pictogram, another is logogram. Father and mother&nbsp;does&nbsp;not appear in pair.</li>
			<li>
				Human male and femal are&nbsp;denoted with complete diffferent method. The male is picotgram, the female is logogram.</li>
			<li>
				There exist word of son, but not word to denote daughter.</li>
			<li>
				There exist elder brother, but not word for elder sister.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Using completely different attitudes and methods to decripe the same mature&nbsp;human being with different gender are called gender asymmetrics phenomimoea (GAP).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, GAP is different from femal discrimination in china history.</p>
