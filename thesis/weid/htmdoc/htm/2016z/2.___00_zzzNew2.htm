				<b>OOA(面向对象)</b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<strong>Introduction</strong></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The object-oriented analysis (OOA) was&nbsp;originally&nbsp;a trival method appeared&nbsp;as terms of &#39;object&#39; and &#39;oriented&#39; in artificial intelligence engineering during late 1950&#39;s. However it suddenly became world-wilde popular terminology during 1990&#39; due to that it was successfully applied into software enginneering&nbsp;to break the&nbsp;traditional procedurals&nbsp;framework in mind and to replace&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lines-Of-Codes (LOC)&nbsp;quantities&nbsp;accumulation process&nbsp;with human&#39;s unlimited abstractive concepulation process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today OOA is one of most important foundimental theories and methods not only in computer science, but also in many other areas, like phylosophy, liguishtic, biology etc. It could be said that today&#39;s software industries would probably&nbsp;still stayed back at a level of DOS command line without OOA.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<strong>Object and Class</strong></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				In English, &#39;object&#39; means a material thing that can be seen and touched.&nbsp; (Synonyms are: aim - purpose - article - objective - goal.) In OOA there is no extra special definition&nbsp;for &#39;object&#39; since the meaning descripted in English dictionary is clear enough.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Objects can be many different types. Some of the objects are uniqueness, like the sun, the moon etc. These object are called singleton in OOA. Some of objects have capability of self-reproduction, like animal, or plants. Some of objects are not countable and have no fixed forms like air, water. Some of object could not be seen and touched directly but could be detected with equipments, like gravity field, photons etc.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				No matter what types of objects, they all have common features called &#39;existance&#39;, or &#39;being&#39;. The study of the nature of being, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations.will have to involve in the philosophical subject called ontology(本体论). More fundamental study of being and world could fall into more broaden areas called metaphysic where the discussion of common topics could be endlessly. Because we are unable to clear know the metaphysics although we have some capabilites to know physics thru repeatable expeirences.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				However, in&nbsp;OOA it does not have any unresolved issues like those&nbsp;raised in metaphysics. Because all objects in OOA are conreate/specific instances of abstract/general ideas called &#39;class&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a&nbsp;more formal definition,&nbsp;a class in OOA&nbsp;is a blueprint or prototype/plan/ template from which the individual objects are created.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The relationship&nbsp;between&nbsp;object and class in OOA&nbsp;are a&nbsp;kind of relationship between the concreate and the abstrace, the specific and the general. It can be further considered&nbsp;as a kind of the relationship between physics and metaphisics proposed by Aristotle in philosophy, or the relationship between wares and words&nbsp; in Chinese classic philosophy, where wares are those under the form and words are those&nbsp;obove the forms (<strong>易经</strong>&bull;系辞: &ldquo;形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器&rdquo;). In the real world, it is full of materials; In pure OO program&nbsp;system, like Java, everything is object. The difference of the relationships between OOA and&nbsp;pyilosopy&nbsp;is that in OOA we know both object and meta-object. Whereas in philogophy we can find evidences of physics but&nbsp;not metaphysics. Due to this correspondance, the unresolved issues in philosophy could be found in simpleified simulated OO software system.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				In English dictionary, the verb&nbsp;&#39;Orient&#39; in OOA means to&nbsp;direct or position toward a particular object. Object-oriented analysis (OOA) means to think, anaylze and design the programs to solve the problems&nbsp;in a way that direct or position toward&nbsp;on&nbsp;the objects as well as the&nbsp;conceptual interpretation&nbsp;of those objects in real world. The OOA method is greatly affected by the study of ontology that&nbsp;possesses inherent consistency with human&nbsp;nature and&nbsp;contained deep humane concern. Hence, recently, the research about ontology is developed widely in computer science.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				We know object thru its properties ane behaviours. Whereas we know class through its features of inheritance, encapuslation, polymorphism etc.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<strong>Inheritance</strong></p>
			<div>
				The inheritance is an important concept in OOA regarding about the relationship among classes, wherein a child class shares the attributes or behaviour of its parents or ancestors. Through inheritance relationship all classes can be virtually linked together to form a family&nbsp;with hierarchy tree. There are two types of inheritance: deriving and compositing. However their primary common purpose of inheritance is to get the reusability of attributes or behaviours among different classes.</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				Seldomly is discussed about the relationship among objects in OOA. Since all objects can be freely cloned or self-reproduced&nbsp;if it is not a singleton, to discuss the relationship&nbsp;among objects are evitable.&nbsp;Druing the objects population process, the state of parents object can natually be passed into children objects. In order to differentiate the concept of inheritance, we call this phynomena as &#39;heredity&#39;.</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				Although both inheritance and heredity are talking about something passing on between parents and children, with OOA introduced in discussion, they are essentially&nbsp;different. Inheritance refer to the attributes or behviours&nbsp;in parents classes&nbsp;that are permitted to reuse by children classes as if the children owned those attributes and behaviours. Heredity refer to the value of attributes or the state of behaviours when duplicated from parents&nbsp;to children. Inheritance passes along the access&nbsp;permission disscussed in encapsulation. Heredity passes&nbsp;on the values of attributes. Inheritance is taling about the copy right. Heredity is talking about the copy value. Inheritance belongs to metaphysics world. Heredity belongs to physics world.&nbsp;And it is more important that inheritance is a design time process, whereas heredity is run-time process.&nbsp; They are totally talking about two different concepts.</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				In English dictionary, these two words show differences:</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				inherit:</div>
			<ul>
				<li class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
					Receive (money, property, or a title) as an heir at the death of the previous holder.</li>
				<li class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
					Derive (a quality, characteristic, or predisposition) genetically from one&#39;s parents or ancestors.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				heredity:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
					The passing on of physical or mental characteristics genetically from one generation to another.</li>
				<li class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
					A person&#39;s ancestry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				Literally, inheritance has preferences on ligetimation, heredity has preferences on genes.</p>
			<p class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				Applying OOA in biology, how can we&nbsp;distinguish between&nbsp;inheritance and heredity? The similarities between two objects coming from different classes&nbsp;are inheritance. The similarities between two objects of same class&nbsp;are called heredity. When similarity happens&nbsp;among objects come from both same and different classes, then both inheritance and heredity coexist.</p>
			<p class="vk_txt" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				Mendals laws, a&nbsp;theory of how hereditary characteristics are passed from parent organisms to their offspring, are totally based on the observation and experienemt on the selected traits on&nbsp;the same type of plant&nbsp;or insect. So his&nbsp;results are&nbsp;only reliable and valid for&nbsp;heredity study but useless for inheritance study.</p>
			<div>
				The hereditary modification is actually a changes of value&nbsp;of its attribute&nbsp;during the object&nbsp;self-reproduction process. Just as mendel&#39;s experiment showed us, the changed value could not permently held or unlimited accumulated. The result show that the values are predefined, enumerated or limited within a certain range. It came forth and back following certain propability rules.&nbsp; The medel&#39;s experiment also showed that we can easily make a significant changes of the values of an existing&nbsp;attributes within short time by changes of enviroments or conditions, but we can not add, remove or change attributes to&nbsp;create a new species no matter how long the time spent, which can be&nbsp;proved thru archeological results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				In the origin of species, written by Charles Robert Darwin, FRS (12 February 1809 &ndash; 19 April 1882), the inheritance and heredity are mixed used and considered as same concept.&nbsp;This misled us to conduct that the run-time chronical accumulated hereditary modifcation&nbsp;is the main power to cause&nbsp;to change the&nbsp;species to come from a common ancestors. There do exists&nbsp;a common root&nbsp;species&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;a hierachy tree family derived from that ancestor, however, this&nbsp;hiearchy tree is not&nbsp;formed chronically through run-time&nbsp;heredity, but formed&nbsp;thru design time inheritance,&nbsp;which&nbsp;can well match the fossils what we found in archological study.</div>

				&nbsp;He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and proposed the&nbsp;hyposis that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.</div>

				Heredity is the passing of traits to offspring (from its parent or ancestors). This is the process by which an offspring cell or organism acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism. Through heredity, variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some species to evolve. The study of heredity in biology is called genetics, which includes the field of epigenetics.</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				Charles Robert Darwin, FRS (12 February 1809 &ndash; 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist.[I] He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors,(1) and proposed the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.(2)</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				However,when we talke about inheritance in our daily life, we usually think about&nbsp;it as the phynomena widely existing in biological regeneration process. The son carries many features that his father has.&nbsp;Passing the&nbsp;traits from a parents to an offspring is not called inheritance. It should be&nbsp;called object clone with different states. Although there exist different&nbsp;in trats between child and parents, &nbsp;their fundimental attributes are kept unchanged. They all are objects&nbsp;generated from same human class.</div>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The similarity between human and ape are&nbsp;due to&nbsp;inheritance in classes. It could&nbsp;be that&nbsp;human class is derived from ape class, or ape&nbsp;class is&nbsp;the child of human class, or ape and human class both are a child class of third pure virtual class. The regeneration process that parents bore a child is a feature of self-clone inherit from animal class.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Human and apes are close in blood, not because of the run time clone and changes, but because of design time class inheritance. The object&#39;s properties values changes in run time&nbsp;and space&nbsp;will never&nbsp; affect its class defined at design time space. Mendel&#39;s pea experiement that there&nbsp;exist significant changes&nbsp;in trait but&nbsp;there are no&nbsp;any changes in species can strongly support the correctness of OOA method.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				For example, Equilateral-Triangle&nbsp; and Right-Triangle are both the child class of triangle. The changes of length of&nbsp;the instance of Equilateral-Triangle&nbsp;can not lead to convert it to become&nbsp;a instance of Right-Triangle no matter how long and how many times it takes.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				There are two types of inheritance, deriving inheritance and compositing inheritance. It is because of the followings in OO that makes world colorful and various:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The design time inheritant hierachy classes</li>
				<li>
					The run time instances of objects initiated from its classes, object clone and change so that different objects has different properites and behaviors.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				types,&nbsp;defination, origin, properties, category etc of nouns, which further fall into subjects of old metaphysics(形而上学), ontology(本体论) or other phylosophy etc.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Many philosophy believes that the nouns can be categloized into <strong>abstract </strong>nouns(the terms&nbsp; refer to ideas or concepts;&nbsp;they have no physical referents.) and <strong>concrete </strong>nouns (the terms refer to objects or events that are available to the senses.). Hence object can be categloized into abstract objects and concrete objects. But it is hard to distinguish the love, happiness, death etc those nouns between the abstract and the concrete.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Also, many philosophy believes that nouns can be categloized into <strong>general </strong>nouns (the terms refer to groups.) and &nbsp;<strong>specific </strong>nouns (theterms refer to individuals.). But&nbsp;it brought us&nbsp;a famous White Horse Dialogue: &quot;A white horse is not a horse.&quot;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Ancient phylosophyer Plato believed that every noun corresponds to a real, eternal and perfect being.&nbsp;The real, eternal, and perfect beings corresponding to nouns&nbsp;was called &#39;ideas&#39;. He believed that the particular objects which the world that we see is made of, like a dog, a person etc, are only&nbsp;the copies of their ideas.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Ancient&nbsp;Chinese metaphysics stated that, the one that is above the form (shape and status) is called dao (words), the one that is under the form is called Qi (utilities, objects). There is a correspondance relationship thru form&nbsp;between invisible word and tangible object.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Being different from philosophy, OOA uses a term called &#39;class&#39; to represent the&nbsp;abstract, general, conceptual data type and&nbsp;ideal world&nbsp;to relatively differeniate from itself to &#39;object&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In concept,&nbsp;each object corresponds to a class from which the object was&nbsp;generated. In a pure OOP system,&nbsp;like Java,&nbsp;everything are objects, each of which has its own properties, behavors, states, life cycles etc.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Human knowing process can be divided into two types (1) from practice to theory, this is a process from concrete to abstract, individuals to general. (2) from theory to practice, this a process applying the abstract, general theory into conrrete, individual practical cases. The term &#39;orient&#39; means &#39;toward&#39;, object-oriented means to apply the knowledge of classes to mimic the objects in real world to solve the problems.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Although OOA could not solve all existing philosophy issues, the model it setup can be fully implemented thrugh object-orientd design (OOD) and oject-oriented programming (OOP). The achievement made due to&nbsp;OOA application&nbsp;in industries further provide that OOA&nbsp;possesses inherent consistency with our nature world.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				For example, Plato believed (1) that corresponding to every common noun there is a real, eternal, and perfect being, in the&nbsp;likeness of which and by the power of which every particular being coming under that class is made; (2) that, corresponding to the system of common nouns, there is a system of such real, eternal, and perfect being; and (3) that, corresponding to the highest common noun, there is a highest being , which is the the prime source of all lower beings and so of all things whatever.&nbsp; The real, eternal, and perfect beings corresponding to our common nouns Plato called ideas. The highest idea is God.&nbsp; Now while he believed that there ideas are pure, holy, and beautiful, he believed that the particular objects which the world that we see is made of -- the actural trees, hourses, etc. -- are only imperfect copies of their ideas, and are, therfore, not at all pure, holy, and beautiful, but just the contrary. Plato the teacher: being selections from the Pology, Euthydemus, Protagora, by Plato.</p>

				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				All objects initiated from its classes that has different states, properites and behaviors. A class is a blueprint or prototype/plan/ template/gene from which the individual objects are created.</p>

				有的哲学家，如柏拉图学派认为：任何一个名词都对应着一个实际存在；另外一些哲学家则主张有一些名词并不代表存在的实体，而只代表一种集合的概念，包括事物或事件，也有抽象的，由人类思维产生的事物。例如&ldquo;社团&rdquo;就代表一群具有同一性质的人组成的集合；&ldquo;几何&rdquo;就代表一种特殊知识的集合等。</p>

				In order to better understand an object, we need to know the origin of that object. This method is very common in our daily life. To know a person in deep, we usually try to get to know his parents or family. To study species, we want to explore the origin of species. The ultimate purpose of archeology, anthropology, history etc, is to nothing but to try to understand where we came from in order to better understand who we are. To focus on the oigin of a object rather than the object itself, is what we called today Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) method.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The term of OOA was originally coined in hardware design in electrical engineering but&nbsp;became world widely known after it was successfully applied in software industry since early 1990s due to its power to tremendously simplify the complexity at the point when human&#39;s brain reach its limit to handle its exhausted huge size of codes from binary, assembly&nbsp;to human like languages.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The mothod&nbsp;developed from&nbsp;OOA&nbsp;can be&nbsp;applied in many disciplines, just like Grandy Booth discussed in of his book, such as biology, linguistics, psychology,&nbsp;legistmates&nbsp;etc.</p>
			<p>
				Indeed, OOA is one of ways to view how our world is created, organized and developed from a specific angle that is different from other theories, philogophies or religous believes.</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				In OO, world is composed of all kinds of objects. An object is something in real world&nbsp;that people can&nbsp;name it, a person, a dog, a proton, a chemical element, a solar system, a universe, the magnet field, the light, a country, a community, a society, a theory, a thougth, etc. All objects initiated from its classes that has different states, properites and behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;A class is a blueprint or prototype/plan/ template/gene&nbsp;from which the individual objects are created. Class is composed of three things: a name, attributes, and interfaces that models the state and behavior of a real-world object.</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				Two ways in OO that makes world colorful and&nbsp;various:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The design time&nbsp;complicated hierachy&nbsp;classes</li>
				<li>
					The run time instances of objects&nbsp;initiated from&nbsp;its classes&nbsp;that&nbsp;has different states, properites and behaviors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
			</ol>

				The believe that life originated in water suggested by Thales (about 600 BC), men developed, by graudal stages, from fish suggested by&nbsp;Anaximander (611-547 BC), life began in orimordial slime suggested by Anaximenes (588-524 BC)</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">

				It is a way how the world is effectively created. In biology for example, human being can be classified in mammals. So the human inherits all features of mammal.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">

				Simply speaking, OO is the way to view the complicated system as a well organized simple composition of simple existing or conceptual objects and begin with the study of internal property of object and external relationships between the objects in order to master the whole system.</p>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Encapsulation.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Any modern languages, its writing system contains three essentially different rudimental elements. They are words, pronunciations and definitions.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				A word here denotes a kind of writing, a symbol, an icon, or a character, printed on papers, screens or similar surfaces planes that can be read thru eyes or hands and interpreted by human brain.� A word has to have a definition. A word that has no definition is an error in the grammar. In this paper word and character are the same.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Pronunciation denotes the aural sound or voice of a word when people speak and can be hear though human ears and identified by human brain. A pronunciation has to have a definition. A pronunciation that has no definitions is the noise.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Definition denotes the concept, ideas, or meaning. It is the unit of human cognation. A definition is the perception of the existence in the world. All languages share some basic common definitions with different words and different pronunciations. If they do not share any common definitions, the translations among languages is impossible.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Word and pronunciation are two different types of mediums in definition message transmission. During the human language communication process, a word itself is a visual carrier of the definitions, whereas a pronunciation is an aural carrier of the definitions. The definition information can be transmitted and received either through the light of word or the acoustic of pronunciation. In spite that both word and pronunciation can not exist without their definitions, a word and a pronunciation can be separated and exist independently on each other.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Although word, pronunciation and definition are the most fundamental elements in linguistics, they do not have internal mechanism to unify three elements together into one object. This lead to two types of languages in the world. They are <span style="color: red;">alphabetic</span> and <span style="color: red;">ideographic</span> languages.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				The alphabetic languages is a written human language in which thousands or unlimited number of all different words are composed of several dozens of standardized set of alphabetic letters � basic simple written symbols. In alphabetic language, there is no any physical or conceptual natural relationship between the words and definitions. The corresponding relationship between words and definition is thoroughly arbitrarily defined or determined by human conventions � dictionary. Hence, people has to remember large mount of definitions of words in brain. The biggest advantage of alphabetic language is that alphabetic languages can easily setup a relationship between the words and its pronunciations through the simple alphabet-sound table. So people can easily reproduce correct pronunciation through the words with simple rules without looking up the dictionary. The alphabetic language in which symbols or letters reflect the pronunciation of the words is also called phonetic language. Examples are Latin, English, Greek, Russian, Thai, Arabic and Hebrew. Alphabetic words are also called phonetic words.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				In the ideographic language, the words use the images, pictures, shapes, forms or outlooks of appearance of existence in the world to represent the ideas. The pictographic words which are abstracted from the hard copy of image of existence has natural relationship between the words and definitions. Using the visual thinking, rather than the hard memory of its convention, people can simply get the definition of the words without the need of any dictionary. There is great appeal in the concept of written symbols conveying their message directly to our minds, thus bypassing the restrictive intermediary of speech. And it seems so plausible. Surely ideas immediately pop into our minds when we see a road sign, a death&#39;s head label on a bottle of medicine, a number on a clock.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				The disadvantage is that �there is no natural relationship between words and pronunciation in pictographic languages. People need hard remember the pronunciations of thousands words one by one without any rules or clues. This was one of the reasons that Chinese language has most different dialets in the world.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Chinese is considered as the only ideographic language which encapsulate the definitions, words, along with the visual art, philosophies together to form the unique writing called characters or Hanzi that is still in use in the world which take most population in the world. Almost all other languages are phonetic languages which take most geographic territory.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Here we can see that there are two type of encapsulation in linguistics. One is call phonetic and another is called the ideographic.�</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Encapsulation is the process of compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitute its structure and behavior; encapsulation serves to separate the contractual interface of an abstraction and its implementation. (p50)</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Currently we can not find significant advantages one over another between phonetic and pictographic languages. The pro and cons may vary at different times at different envrioment. At present computer times, the alphabetic languages has advantage over pictographic languages in the keyboard input method. The split of languages formulate two different kinds of culture in the world. �</p>

				Abstraction:</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Grandy Booch stated: The abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects and thus provide crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective of the viewer. (Grandy Booch 1999. p41)</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">

				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Picture abstraction</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">It is not strange that persons ideas or feeling can be expressed by the drawing. It is nature to use pictures as initial human writing system. </span><span style="color: red;">There is nearly unanimous agreement including theory and myths that all human writing started with pictures.</span> Contrasted to the facts that there are two types of writing system exist in modern times, it is not doubt that there are� <span style="color: red;">two stages in the development of human writing.</span>��</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				In the first stage, in which like Gelb places what he calls &quot;forerunners of writing&quot;(1963:59), the symbols are clearly pictographic in form, though he prefers to call them &quot;descriptive&quot; or &quot;representational.&quot; Examples are Egyptian�s heriegphrphics, Maya iconics. Despites of meager unearthed archeological evidences in China tertiary, that Chinese writing was pictographic in origin does not admit of question.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Pictured languages in first stage can not survive. First, to draw a picture is very complicated and usually spends large mount of time.� Secondly, there is no copy and paste in ancient times, the picture is a burden for reuse in language. Third, the complexity of picture produce the high error rate in writing process. Fourth, pictures take large mount of writing spaces and hence it make the documents very big, heavy and clumsy. Fifth, not all people know how to draw without training. As the civilization continue to constantly develop, it became more and more impossible for the pictures to meet human language need. It is not surprised that pictures eventually disappeared in human writing system except the Chinese.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				The second stage, although we do not have clear time line, started when new principles are developed and applied into writing system so that the long processing and complicated <span style="color: red;">elaborate drawings were significantly simplified and all issues in first stage were overcame</span>. It is also during this stage, the human writing split into two types of languages, ideographic and alphabetic which could not coexist at the same place at the same time. Chinese chose the way of encapsulation of abstracted pictures and definitions in the second stage.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				During the picture abstraction process, <span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">large mount pixels depicting the details of image which is thought to be unimportant were removed. If we compare the Chinese oracles inscriptions with Egyptian heirgraphics, we can clearly find that oracles was already in high degree abstracted from the pictures. The second stage should be far more earlier than Shang(1700BC).</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">All other culture chose </span>phonetics way of encapsulation of words with pronunciations in second stage, in which the pictures are replaced <span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">with the small mount of highly reusable simple symbols which almost do not represent the image itself. Switching the writing from by depiction the visual image to audio pronunciation is a also a natural choice since the oral conversation, which is the elder language and the origin of writing, is used all the time.� As the pictures became the ordered symbolic letters, the pictured language became today�s alphabetic or phonetic language. Form this point, phonetic languages is essentially a digitalized audio recorder. For example , from Egyptian and Sumarian, the proto-Canaanite inscription was</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">developed in about 1700 BC and became the precursor of all the alphabetic writings.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">The words and icons are the same in oracle. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Chinese history did not show the stage of drawing. Egyptian show the developed drawing period.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Concept abstraction</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Besides the picture is abstracted, the meaning of the word is also abstracted by carefully picking up existing objects in world. Not all exiting objects in the world are dragged into writing system. Only the object which can represent certain degree of popularity and significance or importance can be used as Chinese characters. The abstracted picture of sheep is selected to be used as one of the Chinese writing words. It not only represent the type of animal, but also represent the property of weakness, obedience, sympathy. But no abstracted picture of cat is used in Chinese writing system.</span></p>

				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Information hiding:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">In this paper, information hiding means: �The process of hiding all the secrets of an object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics; � (p514</span><span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 8pt;">) typically, the structure of an object hidden, as well as the implementation of its methods.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Information hiding is mainly implemented through abstractions and encapsulations. The process of encapsulation and abstraction in human writing systems is also the process of information hiding, which typically can be summarized as followings:</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
				<li class="MsoNormal">
					Pronunciation Information hiding:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Because Chinese (Hanzi) choose the way of encapsulation of word and definition, the pronunciation information is completely hidden for the readers. Negatively speaking, the pronunciation information is lost in Chinese writing system since the pronunciation information could not be retreaved at all in chinese words.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Depending on the purpose on invention of writing system, if we emphasis on the convenience of oral communication, ideographic will brings troublesome for the new learners and so it has fatal disadvantage over alphabetic languages. Ideographic language may also cause people to be poor in public speaking which is the facts that most Chinese people are not good at express himself orally as compared with the phonetic natives.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				However, since the ultimate goal in writing system are the meaning conduction thru words, if the readers can understand the words without knowing the writers pronunciation, �then the pronunciation is not <span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">important</span> and can be omitted. There is great appeal in the concept in ideographic <span style="color: red;">conveying their visual message directly to our minds, thus bypassing the restrictive intermediary of speech,</span> with human visual thinking, <span style="color: red;">ideas can immediately pop into human minds when seeing them, just like a road sign, a death&#39;s head label on a bottle of medicine, a number on a clock. </span>As compared with phonetic languages in which words perception is implemented through silent speaking as well as both visual transmission and pronunciation conversion, ideographic languages potentially has high speed message process capacities.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				<span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				B<span style="color: red;">y means of readily recognizable pictures and diagrams,</span> it could easily explain why chinese languages for long times in history has no dictionary and grammars at all. The earliest dictionary in chinese history was called ShuoWen (600AD). The earliest grammar appeared within 100 years in Qing(1800AD).</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				The pronunciation information hiding in Chinese writing could easily explain the phenomenon that exist today why Chinese language has thousands of different dialects whereas the unit of its culture has never been broken. Local people can communicate each other using their habitant dialect with the same writing. Long distant remote people can also communicate each other through the same writing without caring of the speaking of other side or the conventions or rules.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				Different history the speaking accent is also different. Today�s official Chinese pronounce came from the mogolian accent. It is why Chinese also called monderine. It is believed by some chinese scholars that Cantonese is original ancient Han speaking. It can explain why the ancient poem is smoothly in speaking by cantoneses</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				It could also explain why Chinese writing has never ever been died no matter how strong it was influenced by Indian and northern tribes cultures for thousands of years. In long history, Chinese was ever conquered and ruled many times by foreigner for hundreds of year, Chinese official speaking was even changes by invaders. The modern official speech is Manderin which is the accent of Mogolian during the chinese ruling. It was believed by some scholars that ancient chinese speak in Cantonese, because it is more smooth to read ancient poem with Cantonese than Mandrin. However, chinese writing is not affected by intruders, on the country, the intruders became the part of chinese.� Chinese has strong flexibility and compatibilities with other cultures.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				In globalization, chinese language <span style="color: red;">with symbols and images, not having any sound information, can be read in all languages while keeping their own inhabitant pronunciations, and form a sort of free intellectual universal writing system</span> including for the disabled<span style="color: red;">, which conveys thoughts by visions or touches</span>. In such case, all languages of speaking like English, Indian or Arabic became the dialects of the Chinese language.</p>

				In ideographics, during the picture abstraction process, although <span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">large mount pixels depicting the details of image which is thought to be unimportant were removed, the similarities and beauties of the original images were still be able to be kept in words, which could restore the hiding pixels and make Chinese words unique in that the art and writing are not dividable in calligraphy. </span></p>

				<span style="font-family: &quot;ArialMS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt;">Besides, through picture abstraction, the meaning of the words became less concrete and more enhanced. Abstraction play one of key roles for chinese to survive into the modern time from the ancient picture writings without losing the picture properties.</span></p>

				A picture can depict a vivid story. One picture worth one thousand words. Chinese word is an abstracted picture. There is no doubts that Chinese words contains large mount of stories. The problem is how can a definition of a word particularly correspond to that story of its own pictogram but not others.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
				For example, there can draw thousands of different kinds of pictures with different stories to express the concept of the word �envy�. But Chinese only use the picture with two trees and a woman to represent the meaning �envy�. Unless the story is well-known and can be easily accepted, the word could not last until today if the story is arbitrarily made up by the inventors.</p>

				There are large mount of hiding information in chinese words. The purpose of information hiding is not to make it secret or mysteriously but to facilitate the usages of chinese writings system. �People can ignore those hiding information which is not essential to its definitions, focus on the plain textual definitions, compose their own articles to express their own ideas. The ideas of the author who use the chinese words may completely different or even contradict to its initial ideas of the words when inventors crated them. �Hence study the ancient Chinese collections may not help very much on explore of hiding information. There are two worlds, that has certain relationship between them but also relatively independent to each other in chinese writing: the public world and the hiding world.</p>

It is also very important to explore and to restore the truth of original chinese culture as chinese is getting away of its ancisters further and further. However, for several thousands years, none of efforts has never ever been made in the chinese hiding world until Kong�s discovery published in 1950. </span></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				In our oracle writings study, inheritance denotes the process by which new words called <em>derived</em> or child words are created from existing words called <em>base or parent words</em>. The derived words have all the features, properties and definitions of the parent word besides new added features specific to the newly created derived word.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				In software industry, the inheritance supports reusability and reduce the codes redundancy. In oracle</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Inheritance make people to focus on several hundreds Chinese root characters, rather than thousands of different characters, although it is still quite much as compared with about dozens of letters in alphabetical language, it greatly reduced the memory stress. The inheritance greatly reduced the number of the different writing, greatly simplified the words system and standardized the writing system.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Unlike alphabetic language, which all words can be put together in index order, Chinese language is difficult to put them in a dictionary to look up. Inheritance make it possible to put large mount of Chinese words in a herarchy charts, set up a relationship between words, and make it possible to have blind search, �make people easier to remember all words through simple rules.</p>

				Modularity</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				In engineering, it is believed that: the partitioning a complicated system into smaller individual components can reduce its complexity. This leads to the creation of concept of modularity.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Modularity is the property of a system that has been decomposed into a set of cohesive and loosely coupled modules.(p57)</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				All Chinese words are derived from several hundreds of root characters. Unlike the alphabetic languages, its root words increased or decreased as time or technology changes, Chinese root characters hardly change although the number of Chinese words kept changed and once reached up more than 40k. They kept persistency in all long history. When a new thing comes up, always there is a simple way to name it either through the formulation of a new derived words, or the make of a new short words phrase. �The root characters play the role of individual concept units in complicated Chinese writing and linguistic system to let users to fully express the will.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The act of partitioning a complicated system into individual components in order to reduce its complexity is not easy. The high degree of modularization make the Chinese language simplified in the users thoughts expression. Since each set of words is cohesive, and relationship between words are loosely coupled, the sequence order of words is less important. The composition of words is important. There is no grammar is needed in Chinese. Chinese are the only concept modularized language that exists in the world.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The study of the modularity of Chinese words can also help us to understand the purpose of invention of oracle and the origin of oracle.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				There is no significant differences between word and picture. There is no significant differences between the word and book.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Each word has cohesive rich meaning. If it is explained, it will need a book. All words are equal in grammar. No verb, or none, prep, adjective etc. no grammar is needed for oracle. So no grammar is required in Chinese words system.</p>

				This principle is widely used among Chinese scholars. However, these principles are very confusing and has lots of issues. As matter of facts these principles are not the original intention of Chinese word inventors. They are the summaries of structural features of later existing Chinese characters.

<span style="color: black;">The theories which have been advanced as to the method of </span></pre>

<span style="color: black;">which regard them as ideographic, as phonetic, or as mixed. </span></pre>
			<pre style="background: white;">
<span style="color: black;">The German writers, Forstemann, Schellhas, and Seler, have </span></pre>

<span style="color: black;">maintained that they are mainly or wholly ideographic ; the </span></pre>

<span style="color: black;">French school, headed by the Abbe Brasseur, de Ros&#39;ny, and </span></pre>
