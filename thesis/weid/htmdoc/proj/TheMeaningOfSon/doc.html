<div p="1">The concept of &#39;son&#39; (Greek: &upsilon;&iota;ό&sigmaf;, huios) plays a special role in the Gospel: Jesus frequently called Himself as &#39;the Son of Man&#39; and referred himself &#39;the Son of God&#39;; God called Jesus as &#39;My Beloved Son&#39;(Matthew 3:17). The word&nbsp;&quot;son&quot; is a title used for specific&nbsp;type of relative member&nbsp;in human family tree. To entitle&nbsp;Jesus as son can raise&nbsp;many questions for both Christians and non-Christians: Is the meaning of &#39;Son&#39; in Christology the same as what people think of family tree in the world? If different, how much differ between the two? What is the theological meaning of &#39;son&#39;? Is it a parable or metaphor of genre? What is the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in eyes of Jesus Christ? Why is Jesus called the Son of Man and the Son of God? Has any other word that can substitute &#39;son&#39;? These questions composed the displine of study as huiosology, which will not only affect Christians how more precisely comprehend the Gospel but also for missionaries and non-Christians about&nbsp;the view of matrimony and other tipics including how to seek personal happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<!---- Unless this "son" refers to the advent Son of God, who is Jesus Chris, the meaning of "son" would perpetually be a mystery. All myths of the son comes from the traditional misinterpretation in the group of the seven sons.  While understanding the craftiness of evil, the evidence also shows the sinfulness of man—God already have equally revealed His Son over the land of China, but its people keep rejecting and mutating. ------->

<section>
<div subpagesize="1">
<div><a id="uid2" name="uid2" subpage_idx="">1.</a> About the Terminology: Huiosology</div>
</div>

<div subpagesize="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The word &#39;son&#39; (Greek: &upsilon;&iota;ό&sigmaf;, huios) is one of the highly&nbsp;frequently used meaningful nouns in the NT&nbsp;(top in OT, 8th in NT)&nbsp;[]. People have no problem to understand it&nbsp;genealogically or biologically.&nbsp; However, when the NT claims that Jesus is &#39;the Son of God&#39;, and when Jesus&nbsp;called Himself as &#39;the son&#39; and&nbsp;&#39;the Son of Man&#39;, it strands many, especially for the non-believers.</div>

<div p="1">Historical theologians and scholars have spent significant time on the&nbsp;debate of the trinity, especially in the first five hundred years. Although the&nbsp;topics covers the sonship, the discussion&nbsp;mainly focuses&nbsp;on the union of the three (Father, Son and Spirit). After the Reformation, more and more research began to narrow down on &#39;the son of man&#39; and &#39;the son of God&#39;, whereas, the study mainly limited in&nbsp;scopes where&nbsp;the phrases defined. Rare documents in the western history can be found so far that&nbsp;takes the word of &#39;son&#39; as a solitary target for broadly reseach.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">One reason could be that the conept of &#39;son&#39; is too simple for them to deserve to discuss -- it is meaningless to study it if it is disconnected to the Gospels.&nbsp;Another reason could be that the&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;concept of&nbsp;&#39;son&#39; was rooted&nbsp;so deeply in a culture&nbsp;that no other concept can be tolerated to come in. To orient the origin of &#39;son&#39; in a&nbsp;culture usually would end with the clueless.</div>

<div p="1">There is no doubt that better understanding the meaning of &#39;son&#39; can help to better construe&nbsp;the phrase &quot;the son of man&quot; and &quot;the Son of God.&quot; Indeed, it is critical to solve those theological issues since &#39;son&#39; is an atomic element that cannot be replaced by any other words in christology. i.e. &#39;the son of God&#39; cannot be replaced by &#39;the child of God&#39; or &#39;the daughter of God&#39; because God in person called Jesus as &#39;My Beloved Son&#39;(Mat3:17, Mat17:5),&nbsp;&quot;Out of Egypt I called my son&quot;&nbsp;(Mat2:15).&nbsp;Besides, Jesus called God as &nbsp;&#39;Father&#39; for about seventy times in the Gospels.&nbsp;In christological sonship relationship between Jesus and God,&nbsp;&#39;son&#39; cannot be&nbsp;pararell to &#39;child&#39; or &#39;daughter&#39; to&nbsp;belong to a same class as it is in literature as an offspring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">However, it can be found in the paper that, to dig into the concept of &#39;son&#39; to see if there is a biblical meaning over the traditional literal definition, is complicated and&nbsp;related to many diciplines. To simplify this, it&#39;s necessary to&nbsp;define&nbsp;a term huiosolgy (hwee-o-sology)&nbsp;to put all knowledge related to &#39;son&#39; together to faciliate scholars for systematic research.&nbsp;Such kind of methodology has already been used in theology, for&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">example:</span></div>

	<li>Paterology(Theology proper) - the study of the Father or the character of God</li>
	<li>Angelology &ndash; The study of angels</li>
	<!----      https://www.gotquestions.org/Bibliology.html -->
	<li>Bibliology(Biblical theology) &ndash; The study of the canonical Bible, the Word of God</li>
	<li>Christology &ndash; The study of Christ</li>
	<li>Ecclesiology &ndash; The study of the church</li>
	<li>Eschatology &ndash; The study of the end times</li>
	<li>Hamartiology &ndash; The study of sin</li>
	<li>Pneumatology &ndash; The study of the Holy Spirit</li>
	<li>Soteriology &ndash; The study of salvation</li>
	<li>Theological anthropology &ndash; The study of the nature of humanity.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div p="1">
<div>Huiosology can be considered as a branch of Christology to study the &#39;sonship&#39; of Jesus to&nbsp;particulary solve the following issues commonly&nbsp;raised among non-believers:</div>

<div>(1) Is the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in christology the same as in&nbsp;cultural literature? If different, how much differ between the two? Is &quot;son&quot; in christology used as the parable/metaphor of genre? If so, has any other words or concepts&nbsp;that can substitute &#39;son&#39; without changes of the original meaning? if not, what is the theological meaning of &#39;son&#39;?</div>

<div>(2) What is the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in eyes of Jesus Christ and God? What is the biblical meaning of &#39;son&#39;? Why did God call Jesus as &#39;the Son&#39;? Why did God send a &#39;son&#39; rather than a &#39;daughter&#39; for redemption?</div>
</div>

<div p="1">With such clear boundares defined, huisology can help people to open mind&nbsp;to allow the modern ideaology in different disciplines&nbsp;to participate the research. In order to demonstrate such benifit, this paper applies&nbsp;Object-Oriented Method (OOM), a famous theory and methodology of&nbsp;computer science,&nbsp;to enrich the huiosological theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">While huisology can provide a more systematic and reliable theory&nbsp;to bridge&nbsp;people to better understand&nbsp;&#39;the son of man&#39;, &#39;the son of God&#39; as well as the&nbsp;trinity and other theological issues, huisology also can&nbsp;make it easier to rebuke&nbsp;the heresy, like Darwin&#39;s evolution theory, &ldquo;the divine Mother&#39; heresy&nbsp;and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1"><strong>In the West</strong></div>

<div p="1">Although the theology oriented in the west and is the richest in history, huisology is a blank. A.</div>

<div p="1"><strong>In the East</strong></div>

<div p="1">The earliest document related to huisology study can be found in a book of Chinese offiical Bibliography of Seven Areas (七略).&nbsp;Probably it was written by Chinese scholar Liu Xiang 刘向 (77BC-6AD).&nbsp;one of the seven Areas is called the various-huis&nbsp;(诸子略). If the information can be verified, the collected&nbsp;documents&nbsp;can be considered as the eariest huisological study&nbsp;in human history. Ironically, China does not have theologians until twenty century, like Protestant theological thinkers T. C. Chao (1888-1979), Chinese theologian Wu Leichuan(1870-1944), Taiwanese Shoki Coe (1914-1988) and so on.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">In Book of New Tang (新唐书, 1060-1127), classic books are divided into four parts, one of which is called huios part. (新唐书.艺文志一: &ldquo;两都各聚书四部，以甲乙丙丁为次，列经史子集四库。&rdquo;) In the huios part, it contains the works of Confucius, Daois, Moism, Legalism and so on.</div>

<div p="1">In Book of Four Warehouses (SiKu Quanshu 四庫全書, accomplished in 1782) and the Bibliography of Chinese Classics (中国古籍总目, published in 2013), the huios is always listed in the third among the four parts.</div>

<div p="1">There is no historical documents articulating why huios was used as a category in Chinese classic documents. Also, there is no text particularly discussing about the huios. However, term of &#39;huios part&#39;, which is used for the categorization of classics, can be considered as the earliest prototype of huiosology.</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid2" name="uid2" subpage_idx="">3.</a>Significance of&nbsp; the Study</div>

<div p="1">In theory, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are three different terminologies for three different concepts. However, in reality, they are in one of triune and cannot be seperated. Moreover, the Son is Jesus; the Father is God. Whenever the Son is mentioned, it means the Father (God), the Spirit, Jesus Christ at the same time. Son and Jesus, Father and God&nbsp;are interchangable in the Bible due to their one to one unique relationship. It is due to the sin and human limitation that a man can only catch one at a time in a serial way rather than a parellel way. When man discuss one of them, he is subject to forget others. These&nbsp;factors make people difficult to understand or express the biblical meaning of the Son.</div>

<div p="1">Historical theologians studied the huios from perspectives of the Father and the Spirit. With such method, they seperated the Father (God) and the Spirit from the trinity to formulate the theories for Peterology and Pneumatology. But they rarely seperated huios from triune and studied it independently. Some studied the huios from perspective of theological anthropology. There are peterology, Pneumatology and anthropology but not huiosology. These factors make the study of huios very limited. To study the huios independently can help better to better understand the trinity.</div>

<div p="1">From a missiological viewpoint, it is easier for atheists to believe in God or Jesus as an individual than to belive in the only Son of God as Jesus Christ. The theological material is rich in Peterology, Christology and Pneumatology. However, it is a barren field for pastors and missionaries to preach about the son. Some may think that the meaning of son is self-explanation in our daily life. Everyone knows what is son. As matter of fact, people understand son It is such barrier that blocks many people to smoothly come to the triune Jesus.</div>

<div p="1">The term Object-Oriented (OO) was originally initiated in Artificial Intelligence engineering area in late 1950&#39;s <sup title="McCarthyJBraytonR1960">[]</sup>. The word &quot;oriented&quot; comes from the verb &quot;orient&quot; which means: <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dataversity.net%2Fa-short-history-of-ontology-its-not-just-a-matter-of-philosophy-anymore%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DEtymologically%2520the%2520term%2520ontology%252C%2520like%2Cthe%2520early%252017th%2520century.%20%2D%2D%3E-->

	<li>to begin with reference to a real object observed in the world.</li>
	<li>to direct or position toward that particular object programmed.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div p="">Object-Oriented Methodology (OOM) became popular first in software industry in 1990&#39;s. In computer science, Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &quot;object&quot;, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</div>

<div p="">The core idea is based on the observation that the world, from micro to macro, is composed of objects. Each object is a relatively independent living instance that has its own feature including static property (attribute or characteristic, traits, attributes) and dynamic behavior (or functionality, procedures) two parts. Also, it can be observed that different objects may share the same or similar property and behavior. Objects that have the identical property and behavior are classified as a type. With such worldview, it can be proposed that the world is composed of various types of numerous objects.</div>

<div p="">From a software programming perspective, property and behavior are two different things: property is the data of collected information whileas behavior is the calculation of process transaction. To collect and identify the data for property is a tremendous job that is different from the complicated algorithm based calculation required for behavior or functionality. Earlier programmers tend to think and handle data and calculation in two isolated memory spaces.</div>

<div p="">Object-Oriented Methodology (OOM) is based on a philosophy that property and behavior are indivisible. In theory, property and behavior are two different areas and can be studied seperatedly, however, in reality, property and behavior cannot exist independly. For example, a life with feminine property always appears and acts in female behavior. OOM suggests that programmers should consider the object as the basic unit in programming rather than data and operation. They should encapulate or wrap both property and behavior into object so that they can focus on the objects and their relationship in any project. OOM is a way just like the process that people observe and describe about the world. To distinguish OOM to any other method in software engineering, OOM provides following basic concepts and theroies: <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2DThe%20so-called%20class%20is%20the%20classified%20abstracted%20%22object%22%20according%20to%20its%20type.%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20The%20data%20is%20also%20called%20%22property%22%2C%20the%20algorithm%20is%20also%20called%20%22method%22%2C%20%22interface%22%2C%20or%20%22function%22%20to%20represent%20internal%20calculation%20process.%2D%2D%3E--> <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%25Such%20formulation%20process%20from%20objects%20to%20classes%20is%20called%20abstration.%20%2D%2D%3E--></div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(1) Type vs Class</div>

<div p="">Type is the common features of objects with the same charactacterics, including both static properties and dynamic behaviors, which can distinguish itself to others as in a category. In theory, the number of features is unlimited. In practice, only limited but essential features, which is called &#39;class&#39; in programming, can be collected to represent its type of objects.</div>

<div p="1">The process to identify a type from objects, or to define a class from a type, is called the abstraction. Abstraction is essentially a human intellectual cognition. Hence, type or class only exists in human mind, whereas object exists in real world.</div>

<div p="">In computer science, run-time refers to the period and space during which a computer program is executing in machine, whereas, design-time refers to the period and space during a design process. Any application program will undergo these two phases.</div>

<div p="">OOM changes the traditional mixed coding of data and calcuation to become two different phases: Abstraction and concretization. Concretization is the process of planning a system of interacting objects for the purpose of solving a problem.</div>

<div p="1">Although concretization is part of object-oriented design, it ultimately is accomplished in run-time space. Whereas abstraction is always accomplished in design-time. Once the codes are in exectuion, run-time objects and the design-time classes never interfere each other.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(3) Inheritance vs Heredity</div>
<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%20%5Csubsection%7BInheritance%20and%20Heredity%7D%20%2D%2D%3E-->

<div p="">Although two types of objects are different in categorization, they still may share some common features. Ape and man are example. Indeed, any two types of objects, no matter how different they are, there alway can be found some common features between the two. All object composing the world are connected in terms of identities of features.</div>

<div p="">Inheritance:</div>

<div p="">To better understand the relationship among different types according to their similarity, OOM introduces a concept of inheritance. For similicity, assuming two different classes B and C, if class C has all features of class B, then it is said that class C inherits features from class B. There exists an inheritance relationship between B and C. Class B is called the parent class (or base or root class). Class C is called child class.</div>

<div p="">There are three kinds of inheritance: single (a child class inherits only one parent), multiple (a child class inherits multiple parent) and virtual inheritance (a child class inherits parent&#39;s virtual functions). With a well OOD, an application program contains single inheritance only and there exists a top root class.</div>

<div p="">Heredity:</div>

<div p="">Literally, there is no essential difference in meaning between inheritance and heredity. They are interchangable in many cases. However, in this paper, heredity denotes that the transmission of features from an object to its cloned object. The original object is called the parent object. The cloned object is called the child object. The child object can be the whole or part of parent object. After the clone, the parent and child objects can have its own status different to each other. In OOM, the significant difference between the inheritance and heridity is that, inheritance can change types at design-time space, whileas heridity can only change the status at run-time space.</div>

<div p="">Application</div>

<div p="">Understanding the difference between the inheritance and heredity is important to rebuke the Darwin&#39;s evolution theory. The similarity between ape and man is due to inheritances occuring at design-time. There are three possible inheritances: A) man inherits ape. B) ape inherits man. C) ape and man inherit a virutal class. However, the similarity between a father and his son is due to heridity occuring at run-time. The two similarities are essentially differ to each other. A child differs to its parents in apparents (states of feature) but not in feature. Since run-time execution never interferes the design-time process. The offspring of ape, no matter how much it diffes to its ancestor through generations, will never change its type to become man.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(4) Encapsulation</div>
<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%20%5Csubsection%7B%20Encapsulation%7D%20%2D%2D%3E-->

<div p="">The interaction among oobjects is accomplished through the property information exchange and the reaction of the behavior interface. There exist rules of permission to access proptery information and behavior interface. For example, in C++, there are three level of permission: public, protected and private. The public property or behavior is allowed both to access at run-time and inherit at design-time. The protected feature is only allowed to inherit at the design-time. The private feature is not allowed to access at run-time or to inherits at design-time.</div>

<div p="">In OOM, encapsulation essentially is a set of permission rules defined at the design-time, and it cannot be changed at run-time. The protected and private features of objects are not accessible at run-time -- it leads to information hiding, which is good for security and reliability. On the other hand, information hiding could confuse people to understand the objects in the real world. It is likely due to the information hiding that People could not find the essential difference between ape and man.</div>

<div p="">In society, information hiding is way how people interact each other.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(5) Polymorphism</div>
<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%20%5Csubsection%7BPolymorphism%7D%20%2D%2D%3E-->

<div p="">In OOM, polymorphism refers to those behaviors of objects, that are conceptually the same but transact differently for different signatures. For example, rectangle with width and hight is different from the triangle with lengths of three sides in signature. However, the behaviors to get the area of them are conceptually the same, though their calcuation methods are different.</div>

<div p="">Two objects are the same type (class) if and only if they have the same property and behavior including the polymorphism and encapsulation.</div>

<div p="">In the natural world, polymorphism is usually subtle and difficult to identify. Sometimes, it is considered as a kind of mutation or the flexiable or adaptive capability of a type of objects. For example, some turtles are carnivores, while others follow a strictly vegetarian diet. The different foods for the digestion system could be a kind of polymorphism.</div>

<h3 chapter="I" pagesize="1"><a chpnum="" id="uid11" name="uid12">III. </a> Significance of&nbsp;OOM in Theology</h3>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">1.</a> In Ontology</div>

<div p="">At least, there are three important features in OOM that can influence people to re-think the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in human culture.</div>

<div p="">(1) The concept of child class in OOM is identical to the genealogical and biological concept of &#39;child&#39; in human&nbsp;culture in&nbsp;that both possess&nbsp;inheritance and heredity characteristic.</div>

<div p="">(2) The concept of child class in OOM is neutral without sex or gender. Male or&nbsp;female is just&nbsp;a property value of an object in&nbsp;runtime. In another word, it is not appropriate to consider male and female as two classes in OOM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(3) OOM can clearly articulate the difference between the child class and instance of child class.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">These three features can help people to re-think the concept of &#39;son&#39; in a ontological way. While keeping&nbsp;its literal meaning, the OOM can help people to open mind to transcend the traditional sexual way&nbsp;in its culture to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;the meaning of &#39;son&#39; used to describe Jesus&nbsp;&#39;the son of man&#39; or &#39;the Son of&nbsp;&nbsp;God&#39; in&nbsp;a spiritual way.&nbsp; It also help to better understand how God define the term of&nbsp;&#39;son&#39; in a bibilical&nbsp;way.</div>

<div p="">Ontology is&nbsp;a branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality. It&nbsp;deals with questions about what things exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped according to similarities and differences. Metaphysics is a&nbsp;branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space. OOM cannot be considered as a theory or philosophy but rather it is a methodolgy comes from ontology and metaphysics. OOM makes the theory and philosphy about &#39;being&#39; and &#39;which is&#39; simpler by&nbsp;distingushing the concepts bewteen&nbsp;&#39;class&#39; and &#39;object&#39;, which&nbsp;can be simulated through computer programming in run-time and design-time. With such limited human programming experiences, it make it possible for human beings to be able to understand that&nbsp;the round trip between two exclusive worlds is possible for Jesus -- Jesus is both &#39;the son of man&#39; and &#39;the son of God.&#39;&nbsp; To express it literally with&nbsp;articles, Jesus is both &#39;the Son&#39; and &#39;Son.&#39;</div>

<div p="">One of benifits of OOM in software industry is that program&nbsp;can esaily&nbsp;pupulate&nbsp;unlimited number of harmony instances&nbsp;in run-time without duplication effort for human&nbsp;in design-time. The successfulness of OOM in software engineering&nbsp;with unlimited capability to simulate the world, more or less demonstrates that OOM could be a way of how God created the world.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;the can prove that OOM is not only feasible but also practicable and efficient. OOM also tells that complexity is reducible in practice. But OOM lacks a background of theory to support it, which limits the broader application in different areas, on the other hand, which provides a chance to enrich the theory.</div>

<div p="">OOM essentially is a round trip journey between two exclusive worlds: the abstraction of types or classes from run-time to design-time and the concretization of objects from design-time to run-time. Hence, the best theory that can describe OOM has to be ontology, &quot;the study or theory of being or that which is.&quot;, the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being, the study of a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them. Although ontolgy cannot prove that OOM is theorically correct or wrong, true or false, the nearly dead ontology can be refreshed and enriched through OOM.</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">2.</a> In Creationism</div>

<div p="1">Creationism is a belief&nbsp; and worldview that the cusmos, living organism and&nbsp;life and all things originate by specific work of divine creator&nbsp;rather than from estranged natural processes such as evolution. Creationism takes in the biblical account,&nbsp;particularly the early chapters of Genesis, as literally true guides to the history of the universe and to the history of life, including us humans, down here on earth.<sup title="CreationismStanfordEncyclopediaofPhilosophy2018web">[]</sup>&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">From the pattern of the six-day creation in Genesis 1,&nbsp;it can be found&nbsp;that two words are euqlly most significant:&nbsp;said (אָמַר amar) and saw (רָאָה, raah). In each of the six days, the creation&nbsp;always starts with amar&nbsp;before things were created; the creation always ends with the word raah after things were create, except the air of sky&nbsp;that is invisible in the second day.&nbsp;The God&#39;s creation is actually&nbsp;a process of that&nbsp;what God&nbsp;said became what God&nbsp;saw. In another word, it is a saying-seeing transformation process.&nbsp;God&#39;s&nbsp;saying is different from calling or naming (קָרָא <em>qara</em>)&nbsp;that is a description of existing things. In God&#39;s creation, the saying represents what God wanted, it is the will of God, the&nbsp;result of cognition and thinking process.&nbsp;Whereas, seeing represets the accomplishment of what God created.&nbsp;Creationism believes that what God created or made visible or invisible is the world people can percieve&nbsp;today.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">With OOM terminology, saying and seeing in the God&#39;s creation&nbsp;can be further understood as&nbsp;domain transition process from the design-time to run-time. What God said in the beginning of each day is what God accomplished in design time. What God saw or finished&nbsp;are&nbsp;the objects of what God initiated&nbsp;in run-time.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">To be able to understand God&#39;s creation&nbsp;through the saying in run-time and seeing in design-time is not thorough&nbsp;enough. It is also important to know that, in God&#39;s creation, the saying in design-time and seeing in run-time always perfectly match and cannot go across&nbsp;to each other.&nbsp;The perfect match between the thinking and seeing is originally defined as &quot;good&quot; in Genesis. &quot;Un-crossable&quot; means that the design-time and run-time cannot communicate or negotiate each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;To emphasize the importance of such perfect match and inaccessiblity between the two, God signified&nbsp;the seventh day&nbsp;as sabbath. God not only blessed the sabbath but also&nbsp;sanctified&nbsp;it (Gen 2:3). The word sanctification (קָדַשׁ, qadash)&nbsp;means to consecrate, to set apart,&nbsp;to be&nbsp;holy, to be hallowed. But before the fall of man, it originally means inaccessble&nbsp;between the two.&nbsp;Sabbath&nbsp;not only represents the perfect match and &nbsp;inaccessiblility&nbsp;between the design-time and the run-time, between&nbsp;what the Lord said and what the Lord saw, but also represents in the vast array (Gen 2:1) and the&nbsp;inaccessible division between the heaven and the earth. While the creation of the earth&nbsp;was finished in six days, the creation of heaven also was accomplished and they are in all their vast array (Gen 2:1). &nbsp;Sabbath is a seal of what God said and what God saw in creation,&nbsp;which theologically means that the goodness, the justice and the will of God will never change.</div>

<div p="1">Although Sabbath is not part of the physical&nbsp;creation, and&nbsp;often ignored by creationism, Sabbath is not only the indivisible part of the God&#39;s creation but also&nbsp;spiritually&nbsp;more important than the six day creation process, since the Lord of Sabbath&nbsp;is the Son of God, who hold the key and can&nbsp;cross forth and back&nbsp;between heaven and earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The similarity of OOM&nbsp;and creationism can help atheism&nbsp;not only to better understand that God created&nbsp;the world, but also&nbsp;to clearly explain&nbsp;how God created the world. The significant difference between&nbsp;OOM and creationism is that, in God&#39;s creation, the saying and seeing alway perfect match and cannot cross each other because of&nbsp;Sabbath. Whereas in OOM, thinking and seeing can never perfectly match and there is no eternal will. The dismatch between the design-time and run-time is&nbsp;called bug in OOM or sin in theology.&nbsp;</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">3.</a> In Dual Kingdoms Doctrine</div>

<div p="1">The dual kingdoms Doctrine is based on the dual cities model first proposed by Augustine of Hippo (354-430) in his book &quot;The City of God&quot;. From Adam to the end of time, humanity falls into two cities: the mass of the godless, who live the life of earthly men; and the company of spiritual men, born of grace and called to the City of God for all eternity. The Worldly City, said Augustine, is united by the common love for temporal things. The City of God is bound together by the love of God. Augustine considered the church the only human community that worked for the building of the City of God. The state had its place in suppressing crime and preserving peace, but since the state was based on the power of sin, it must submit to the laws of the Christian church.<sup pg="pp. 139-140" title="BruceLShelley2008">[]</sup> <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D-%20Shelley%2C%20Dr.%20Bruce%20L..%20Church%20History%20in%20Plain%20Language%3A%20Fourth%20Edition%20(pp.%20139-140).%20Thomas%20Nelson.%20Kindle%20Edition.%20%2D%2D%3E--></div>

<div p="1">Protestants (like John Calvin, Martin Luther) developed and enriched the dual cities model doctrine.

One kingdom is called the kingdom of law for man or old Adam. The other is called the kingdom of Grace. to teach how to distinguish law and gospel. Luther taught that the world is divided into true Christians and non-Christians, and that the sword is necessary to restrain evil committed by non-Christians. The spiritual kingdom, made up of true Christians, does not need the sword. Luther&#39;s distinction was adopted by John Milton and John Locke. Milton wrote A Treatise of Civil Power. Locke later echoed the &quot;two kingdoms&quot; doctrine: There is a twofold society, of which almost all men in the world are members, and from that twofold concernment they have to attain a twofold happiness; viz. That of this world and that of the other: and hence there arises these two following societies, viz. religious and civil. <sup note="[11" title="LordPeterKing1864book">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">From a perspective of OOM, human language can be generally classified into object-oriented and non-object-oriented two types of languages. The so-called object-oriented language means that the language has certain or strict grammar rules with forms to distintict the differrences in concepts between object and class in the&nbsp;expression.</div>

<div p="1">For example, in Indo-European languages, Semitic languages (only the definite article), and Polynesian languages, the&nbsp;grammar&nbsp;rule of article is specified to express the differences between object and class. In English, &nbsp;&#39;a&#39; or &#39;an&#39; is for infinitive article, &#39;the&#39; is for finitive article. Article is used to specifically refer to instance. Instance and class cannot mixed. &quot;I have a son&quot;. is about the relationship between objects. It is legal in grammar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">however, many of the world&#39;s major languages including: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, many Turkic languages, etc&nbsp;do not have concept of article in its grammar. It is legal in grammar to express like this: &quot;I have son&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">4.</a> In Darwin&#39;s Evolution Theory</div>

<div btitle="1" p="1">An Overview</div>

<div p="1">The evolution theory was initially proposed by Charles Darwin (1809--1882) to explain the reason of the similarity and distinction among various species and individuals&nbsp;in biological world. Today, Darwin&#39;s evolution theory&nbsp;has become a systematic&nbsp;philosophy about how to view the porcess of continuousness of life. Darwin pulished many books and&nbsp;research papers in his life including&nbsp;<em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em> (1839), <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (1859), <em>The Variation of Animal and Plants Underr Domestication&nbsp;</em>(1868),&nbsp;<em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&nbsp;</em>(1871), <em>The Expression of the Emotion in Man and Animals</em> (1872), <em>The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms</em> (1881) and&nbsp;so on.&nbsp;However, the most foundmental theory what Darwin wanted&nbsp;to convince people to believe is that:&nbsp;species is mutable. Darwin stated&nbsp;that &quot;I can entertain no doubt, ...&nbsp;that each species has been independently created&mdash;is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp;Darwin concluded that &quot;In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that ... might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species.&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">To support the&nbsp;idea, he proposed two critical hypothesis:</div>

<div p="1">(1)&nbsp;&quot;natural selection&quot; theory: the best fit between life and its condition of life will determine how and what species will be changed from one to another.&nbsp;Darwin&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that &quot;I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification [of species].&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp; Natural selection is a topic that is discussed most in his work, and that is the most complicated since it associates with almost all displines including biology, psychology, religion, society, moral, and so on.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">(2)&nbsp;&quot;unknown&quot; theory: Darwin openly claimed&nbsp;that there exists some unknown factor in his&nbsp;theory including&nbsp;the unknown origin of our Domestic Productions,&nbsp;the unknown laws of governing inheritance,&nbsp;the unknown law of variability and&nbsp;correlation of growth and so on. But he insisted that &quot;a<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">lthough much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure,&nbsp;</span>I can entertain no doubt,&quot; each speciesis descended from&nbsp;one or several parent-species,&nbsp;some of which &quot;now supposed to be extinct and unknown,&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">under some known or&nbsp;unknown favourable conditions with&nbsp;a certain unknown number of generations.<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;</span>In his light thrown on the origin of man and his history, he predicted&nbsp;that&nbsp;&quot;It has often and confidently been asserted, that man&#39;s origin can never be known.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;He concluded that &quot;This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Based on these, he finally declared that man is the result of evolution&nbsp;from&nbsp;lower species like monkey or ape&nbsp;through&nbsp;natural selection under a certain&nbsp;length of&nbsp;time and enviroment. &quot;The conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other species of some ancient, lower, and extinct form, is not in any degree new.&quot;<sup>[]</sup></div>

<div p="1"><strong>A Spiritual War</strong></div>

<div p="1">For more than hundred of years, Darwin&#39;s evolution theory did not bring any revolution in science and technology but significanly&nbsp;impacted the human faith and activities. It directly influenced Karl Marx (1818 &ndash;1883) to found&nbsp;scientific socialism and communism theory, and theoritically legalized the warlords to launch the world war I&amp;II for the sake of natural selection.&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s evolution theory is not soley&nbsp;a&nbsp;biological heypotheis&nbsp;but a spiritual war against the Chrsitian faith. Darwin wanted to convince&nbsp;that his newly discovered natural selection theory is a&nbsp;law above all. The ultimate purpose of all activities including cognition and all religions&nbsp;are driven by and for the law of natural selection in order to survive.&nbsp;In eyes of Darwin,&nbsp;&quot;There is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God.&quot;<sup>[2]&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;He stated that &quot;The feeling of religious devotion, ... consisting of love, complete submission to an exalted and mysterious superior, a strong sense of dependence, fear, reverence, gratitude, hope for the future, and perhaps other elements, ...&nbsp;is an emotion until advanced in his intellectual and moral faculties to at least a moderately high level [in natural selection]&quot;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;He quoted that &quot;a dog looks on his master as on a god.&quot;<sup>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;He challenged the authority of Genesis:&nbsp;&quot;Man, made in the image of God, was also made in the image of the ape.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Darwin considered Jesus&#39; teaching in Mat 7:12 and&nbsp;Luke 6:31&nbsp;is nothing but a result of natural selection in a form of morality. He stated that &quot;I have so lately endeavoured to shew that the social instincts,&mdash;the prime principle of man&#39;s moral constitution&mdash;with the aid of active intellectual powers and the effects of habit, naturally lead to the golden rule, &#39;As ye would that men should do to you, do ye to them likewise;&#39;&nbsp;and this lies at the foundation of morality.&quot;<strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></div>

<div p="1">Darwin thought the unselifish&nbsp;death for others as a&nbsp;kind of higher level of form in natural selection. He stated that &quot;When a man risks his life to save that of a fellow-creature, it seems more appropriate to say that he acts for the general good or welfare, rather than for the general happiness of mankind [in natural selection].&quot;<sup>[2]</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div p="1">Darwin&#39;s evolution theory was widely considered as&nbsp;one of greatest scientific discovery in history and is required&nbsp;in public school. Indeed, people are infleunced by&nbsp;the evolution theory not because&nbsp;of&nbsp;its&nbsp;mutable species&nbsp;teaching but mainly because of its&nbsp;atheism faith. Grown up in a Christian family and graduated&nbsp;from a&nbsp;famous Christian college (University of Cambridge), Darwin&#39;s rebellions against Christian faith not only demonstrated the fall of the Western Christian culture but also the devolution of human spiritual life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1"><strong>Apologetics with OOM</strong></div>

<div p="1">Scientifically speaking, from the foundmental species mutability&nbsp;theory to the conclusion about the origin of man,&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s theory are wrong. Its natural selection theory contradict to the creationism and is a misleading.&nbsp;Many&nbsp;scientists or scholars disagree&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s theory from many aspects,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;for more than hundred of years, none of them could fully turn it over. There are many reasons.</div>

<div p="1">(1) Darwin was not able to distinguish the inheritance and herredity between the run-time space and design-tiem space. He errously applied the evolution phenonomina in&nbsp;the run-time space into species variation variation of design-time space, and wrongly think the species variation is time based run-time process. Evolution phenomena is common. For example, the language, technology, and human civilization&nbsp;etc. are all the time based evolution process. &quot;every language bears the marks of its slow and gradual evolution.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;On the other hand, devolution phenomena is also common. Natural ecosystem, polution, human spirit, and so on are time-based process getting worse and worse. In Amerian, from Puritianism that pursues&nbsp;the truth but brought the prospeirty, to the Osteenism that pusues the prosperity and will lead to ruin, is also a sample of devolution.&nbsp;In darwin&#39;sm, what is advance and retreat are not clearly and cannot clearly defined. The complixity cannot be considered as advanced, it could the chaos. The simplest cannot be considered as the primitive, restreated. Indeed, truth has to be simple. All principles of nature found is the simplest rule of the complicated world.&nbsp;It&#39;s easy for people to confuse if a software application update is design-time or a run-time process. People are subject&nbsp;to confuse between inheritance and heredity.&nbsp;Syncritism is one of the common caft arts to allure people spiritually. Darwin&#39;s evolution theory itself is a good evidence of the fall of man.</div>

<div p="1">(2) Darwin&#39;s evolution theory was widely considered as a scientific theory since it was built&nbsp;upon facts&nbsp;with more than five thousands of his collected plant and animal specimens, more than a thousand pages of his geological observations, as well as data collected by other scientists. However, overview Darwin&#39;s work,&nbsp; it is nothing but the facts without new creative point,&nbsp;it is full of mental thinking without spiritual spark, it is not inspiring&nbsp;but misleading, it is not joying with&nbsp;peace&nbsp;but worrying to be unselected. Darwin&#39;s collected facts&nbsp;came from the visual&nbsp;observation in&nbsp;nature. Arnheim maintained that vision and perception are creative, active understanding, and that we organize perceptions into structures and form with which to understand them.&nbsp; Rudolf believes that a mind must process two functions. It must gather information and it must process it[RudolfArnheim]. In theory, we can separate these two functions neatly. But in practice, they always work together at the same time. He conclude that the perceiving and thinking in cognition is indivisable. The &quot;Boring figure&quot;, presented by the psychologists E. G. Boring (1886-1968),&nbsp; that is considered as yound lady can also be perceived as a old woman. The same facts used to convince the evolutionary theory can also be used for creationism. Darwin&#39;s theory is the biggest psudeoscience of his times. It is a biggest&nbsp;LOL of this time.</div>

<div p="1">(3) Critics of the evolution theory were&nbsp;numerious but&nbsp;unable to thoroughly turn it <span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>over,&nbsp;because&nbsp;no other better theories&nbsp;could be found to replace it. Darwin challenged that&nbsp;&quot;Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare?&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp; However, if Darwin could&nbsp;know that&nbsp;OOM is a simple and precise&nbsp;natural principle about the origin of species, it&nbsp;would not spend his whole life to defense his problematic theory.&nbsp;Fully understanding of OOM can not only answer all the questions about the origin of species, why and how the variations occurs,&nbsp;&nbsp;but also can perceive the glory of the Creator under His progressive revelation.&nbsp;Instead of leading people to a cul-de-sac in&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s&nbsp;unknown theory, OOM can provide&nbsp;a right direction to be able to see the bright future. At least, the popular&nbsp;and practical OOM not only can accurately point out in details how and where its errors occurs in his species-mutable&nbsp;theory, but also can fill out his unknown theory to be a best candidate among&nbsp;options&nbsp;to&nbsp;fully replace his biological natrual selection principles and fully solve the issues of origin of species. In any case, OOM can help theologians or missionaries to stop dodging&nbsp;or endlessly arguing with the Darwin&#39;s theory, and&nbsp;OOM theory can end the war of Darwin by effectively&nbsp;proving&nbsp;that Darwin&#39;s evolution theory is one of the&nbsp;biggest pseudoscience in history.<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%20%2D%2D%3E--><!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D-%25%20If%20polymorphism%20and%20heredity%20are%20considered%20as%20to%20enrich%20and%20smooth%20out%20the%20variation%20of%20the%20world%2C%20then%20encapsulation%20provide%20the%20limitation%20and%20boundaries%20of%20variation.%20Cat%20and%20tiger%20are%20different%20classes%20no%20matter%20how%20similar%20they%20are.%20Likewise%2C%20man%20and%20ape.%20%20%0A%25In%20programming%20languages%2C%20encapsulation%20is%20used%20to%20refer%20to%20one%20of%20two%20related%20but%20distinct%20notions%2C%20and%20sometimes%20to%20the%20combination%5B1%5D%5B2%5D%20thereof%3A%0A%0A%25A%20language%20mechanism%20for%20restricting%20direct%20access%20to%20some%20of%20the%20object's%20components.%5B3%5D%5B4%5D%0A%25A%20language%20construct%20that%20facilitates%20the%20bundling%20of%20data%20with%20the%20methods%20(or%20other%20functions)%20operating%20on%20that%20data.%5B5%5D%5B6%5D%0A%0A%25%20Computer%20and%20human%20languages%20are%20similar%20in%20many%20ways.%20Both%20are%20script%20languages%20used%20to%20transfer%20information%20from%20one%20world%20to%20another.%20Both%20can%20be%20stored%20in%20physical%20medium%20as%20scripts%20permanently.%20But%20most%20essentially%20they%20both%20have%20to%20go%20through%20OO%20way%2C%20the%20process%20of%20object-class-object.%20This%20is%20particular%20evident%20when%20analysing%20OBI%2C%20which%20is%20not%20only%20the%20object%20oriented%2C%20but%20also%20the%20piture%20oriented%20abstracted%20scripture%20languages.%20%0A%0A%0A%25In%20OBI%2C%20there%20exists%20large%20amount%20of%20similarities%20and%20repeating%20among%20six%20thousands%20idential%20characters.%20For%20systemetic%20analysis%20on%20OBI%2C%20there%20is%20no%20better%20tool%20than%20OO%20method.%20%0A%2D%2D%2D%2D%3E--></div>

<h3 chapter="I" pagesize="1"><a chpnum="" id="uid8" name="uid9">VI.</a>&nbsp;Biblical Meaning&nbsp;of &#39;Son&#39;</h3>

<section><!---------->
<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">1.&nbsp;</a>In the OT</div>

<div p="1">In the book of Genesis, the word <em>Ben</em> (בֵּן, son) first was used with plural noun by God after the fall of man. God said to Eve that &quot;with pain you will give birth to <b>children</b> (בֵּן, sons).&quot; (Gen3:16 NIV) It is noticeable that the word daughter (בַּת) is not mentioned in pair along with son. Neither does it specify the gender of <em>Ben</em> (בֵּן, son)<em>.</em> In the biblical context, the word &quot;son&quot; originally has nothing to do with gender or sex; instead, &quot;son&quot; is associated with sin, punishment and pain that is gender non-specific.</div>

<div p="1">The first person who was actually called &quot;son&quot; is not Cain or Abel, who are the first two children of Adam and Eve. The word son began to be widely used after Cain murdered Abel. Son first is used with Enoch(Gen 4:17), then is used with Seth(Gen 4:25). Enoch is the son of the murdering criminal. (Gen 4:17) Seth is the son in replace of the killed person.(Gen 4:25) &quot;Son&quot; is associated with the meaning of renewing of life.</div>

<div p="1">Cain is the first criminal in history; he is also the first person to utilize the name of his son to protect himself. &quot;Cain was building a city, and he names the city after his son (בֵּן) Enoch&quot; (Gen 4:17) It seems to Cain that the physical castle is not enough, he also has to attach the name of his son onto the fortress to effectively protect him from punishment to gain safety and peace. It is not unreasonable for Cain to do so. Although his baby son is not strong nor is he a great figure, his son is innocent. It is intuitive for Cain to make use of the label &quot;Baby On Board&quot; to protect himself. It can be seen that the word <em>Ben</em> (&quot;son&quot;) initially has a functionality of the expectations that criminal parents could be exempt from the punishment in his life and the afterlife.</div>

<div p="1">Cain probably never knew the true reason behind the power of son. There is another person also called Enoch, the son of Jared, the offspring of Seth, the seventh grandson of Adam. &quot;Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.&quot;(Gen 5:18) Being different from Enoch the son of Cain who has nothing special, Enoch the son of Jared is famous and unique. Enoch the son of Jared can bring hope for anyone who has a son. The story of Enoch the son of Jared is the beginning of the connection between son and the auspicious sign that is earlier than the son-preference in many cultures.</div>

<div p="1">The story of cognominal Enoch implies that <em>Ben</em> (son) contains the meaning of not only the expectation of being exempt from punishment on earth, but also the hope of being saved by God. After Seth had a son, men began to call on the name of the Lord. (Gen 4:26) The concept of &quot;son&quot; and the concept of the Lord are closely related and equally important. A significant difference between them is that the name of the Lord is forbidden to misuse. (Deut 5:11) Whereas, the word son is free to use.</div>

<div p="1">Another significant difference is that the word son plays an important role in the OT to predict the advent of Jesus Christ. A typical example can be seen in the oracle of Isaiah. <span>&quot;For to us a child is born, to us a son (בֵּן) is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&quot; (Isa 9:6 ESV)</span> <span>Ultimately, the word son becomes an alternative term for Messiah in the OT.</span></div>

<div p="1">Indeed throughout the whole OT, the concept of son always directly or indirectly infer to the advent Jesus. For example, when Abraham is tested (Gen 22), his only son Isaac becomes a prefigure to imply the sacrifice of Jesus. The story of the winding path of the life of Joseph (Gen 37-50) is a foreshadow of the victory of the salvation of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div p="1">The predictive information of son not only embedded in the OT through all kinds of devices and stories, it is also hidden in the statistic data such as the high frequency of usage of the word <em>Ben</em>. In the book of 1Chronicle, the word <em>Ben</em> (son) is repeated for 163 times. It is through the repetition of the word to keep reminding readers to watch out what the Scripture implied.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Through the hindsight, it is clear that the concept of <em>Ben</em> (&quot;son&quot;) carries a mission of God. Within the biblical context of the OT, the word of <em>Ben</em> (son) has metaphorical meaning behind its common gender-based biological definition. The word son is associated with sin, pain, as well as the expectation, hope, justice and salvation. From a soteriological perspective, <em>Ben</em> (son) always directly or indirectly refers to the Messiah throughout the OT. The word son is a prophecy term for the advent of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">2.&nbsp;</a>In the NT</div>

<div p="1">In the NT, the worldly word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Huios</em>) is specially used to express a unique relationship between Jesus Christ and God: Jesus is the only Son of God, and God the Heavenly Father of Jesus Christ. The sonship relationship between the holy Son and the holy Father is to demonstrate that Jesus fully inherited all natures of God including the almighty power, the Kingdom and the glory. From a perspective of the Word (Logos), Jesus was with God in the beginning. Jesus was God. (John 1:1)</div>

<div p="1">Meanwhile, the worldly word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Huios</em>) is also used to express the relationship between Jesus and man. Jesus called Himself the son of Man. However, Jesus did not mean that man is His parents or father. Jesus is the son of man because the Father (God) has set his seal on Him. (John 6:27) In other words, Jesus is not the real son nor stepson but the adopted son of man. Jesus has no any genetic relationship with man. He did not inherit anything sinful from man. However, it is totally legal for anyone to adopt Jesus as his own son for his heritage, expectation and hope in the afterlife. Indeed, Jesus is the only son given to man for adoption. &quot;Those who have the Son has the eternal life&quot; (1John 5:12) Human salvation is accomplished through the sonship adoption process rather than the labors or good deeds.</div>

<div p="1">On the other hand, Jesus was not &quot;willing&quot; to be the son of man. It was the heavenly Father who force Him to be the son of man. He was born in a poor family of Mary and Joseph. He never felt proud to be the son of man nor his Jewish culture nor his family on earth. Jesus never called nor admitted anyone in the world as His mother or father. (Mat 12:48) But Jesus endured accomplishing all the duty what a son should do. Moreover, Jesus was forced to inherit all flesh weakness of man. He had to endure all shames, guilties, failures, bitterness and death of man. Jesus was heavily oppressed both by God and man. From this perspective, to be the son of man means to be like a poor little child being maltreated physically and spiritually by his parents.</div>

<div p="1">In a word, the &quot;son&quot; in the Gospel not only means a male offspring of his parents, and the role of expectation and hope of his parents for afterlife, but also implies an inheritance relationship between the only Savior and the God, the only Savior and the saviee, as well as the role of the God&#39;s salvation plan. Through the word of &quot;son&quot; and the multiple sonships of Jesus Christ, the common worldly sense of &quot;son&quot; has been contextualized to refer to the savior who is Jesus Christ&mdash;the Only Son of God. &quot;Whoever has the Son has life;&quot; (1John 5:12) Obviously, in the NT, the word son has a soteriological meaning that refers to Jesus Christ.</div>
</section>

<h3>III. Common Questions about &#39;Son&#39;</h3>

<section>
<div p="1">The common definition of &quot;son&quot; provides a strong rapport between the Messiah and Jesus Christ. The equalization between the Messiah and Jesus Christ is accomplished through the incarnation of the Word. Jesus said, &quot;Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.&quot; (Luke 4:20) In the NT, the soteriological meaning for son (<em>Huios</em>) is Jesus Christ; in the OT, <em>Ben</em> (son) always implies the advent of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(1) Why is it the son rather than daughter that is used to refer to Jesus Christ?</div>

<div p="1">The word son (Hebrew: בֵּן, <em>Ben</em>) first appears in a plural noun directly from the mouth of God (Gen3:16). Although it refers to the descendant of woman, it is under a biblical situation after the fall of man during the judgment of God when the earth (אֲדָמָה) was cursed.(Gen 3:16) The meaning of the descendant or offspring is not emphasized, instead, the concept of <em>Ben</em> (son) focuses on the meaning related to the sin, curse, punishment and pain (Gen 3:16). Further, the word son began to be used for individual only after the first crime occurred. First, it is used with the son of the murder Cain (Gen 4:17); then, it is used for Seth who is in place of the killed Abel. (Gen 4:25) The biblical context demonstrates that, in the eyes of God, the word <em>Ben</em> (son) <span>has nothing to do with gender or sex, instead, the concept of son is associated with sin, curse, punishment, pain, hope, and renew of life and so on, all of those are the concept without gender or sex.</span> In a general sense, the word son can be translated as child.</div>

<div p="1">The word daughter (בַּת) is not mentioned until after son has been used for four or five times individually. The word daughter is first used in a context to describe the offspring of Seth (Gen 5:4) and used with son in a pair. However, although in the same context, there are words of male and female (Gen 5:2), neither son nor daughter is specified with the gender. In other words, son is not associated to male; daughter is not associated to female. The concept of son and daughter is still gender non-specific.</div>

<div p="1">Seth is the third child of Adam to replace his murdered brother Abel.(Gen 4:25) The expression of sons and daughters of Seth implies that the sons and daughters are the offspring of the replacement of the killed person. The primitive root of the word <em>Ben</em> (son) has a meaning to build, rebuild, establish, cause to continue. The primitive root of Buth (daughter) comes from <em>Ben</em>. Just like the relationship between Adam and Eve, and like male and female God created, son and daughter carries the meaning of the recreation of God after death.</div>

<div note="There is no any city is named after the name of daughter." p="1">Since son already has the meaning of offspring of the sin (Gen 3:16). As an additional word to express the meaning of descendant, the information of the offspring of the killed person naturally falls on the word of daughter and becomes a key nature to distinct itself from son. Also, since the concept of son contains the meaning of hope and has roles of prediction of Jesus Christ in the OT. Thereafter, if son is considered relating to the protector and savior, then daughter would be related to the protectee and saviee. Initially, the distinction between the pair of son and daughter is not based on gender or sex, but based on the soteriological roles in the concept of salvation of God.</div>

<div p="1">As far as the duty of filial piety for parents and the mission of God, son and daughter have no difference. But regarding the role and functionality, they differ significantly. Only the son has the legal right to succeed the house-head position of his father. To accomplish the legal duty, when son grows up, he has to become a bridegroom to bring the bride into the family to fulfill the mission of marriage. &quot;the bride belongs to the bridegroom.&quot; (John 3:29) While He was a son of man on earth, Jesus wanted to be a bridegroom. Jesus answered, &ldquo;How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.&quot; (Mark 2:19-20) From a missiological viewpoint, son represent the missionary and daughter represents the lost one.</div>

<div p="">According to the Parable of the Great Wedding Feast (Mat 22:1-14, Luke 14:15&ndash;24), the Son of God is the bridegroom, the union of saviees is His bride. In the eyes of Jesus, the most beautiful bride is not based on the gender but based on the heart of the love of Him. The salvation is accomplished through the marriage between the Son of God and the children of God. This could explain why polygamy was illegal but permitted in the royal family in the OT time. It is not only &quot;because of the hardness of your heart&quot; (Mat 19:8), but also because of that, indirectly, it could be a shadow of the advent of salvation in the Heaven. Indeed, in the heaven, people will not be bothered by sexual desires, &quot;At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they be like the angels in heaven&quot; (Mat 22:30) On the earth, the role of sex is designated to maintain the existing of the race on earth due to the death of individuals. The sexual desire could be a power stronger than the will of man. The sexually driven marriage on earth is used to imply the salvation and the love of God in heaven. But from a missiological viewpoint, son represents the active lover and daughter represents the passive beloved.</div>

<div btitle="1" p="1" refer1="">(2) Why is God called the Father rather than the Mother?</div>

<div p="1">The word father (אָב) and mother (אֵם) first appear before the fall of man, after Eve is created from a rib of Adam, and within the context of the pair of a man (אִישׁ) and a wife (אִשָּׁה). (Gen 2:24) Originally, father and mother contain the meaning of a perfect family within four basic members.</div>

<div p="1">Eve originally is called &quot;woman&quot; by both God (Gen 2:22) and Adam (Gen 2:23). The context clearly shows that &quot;woman&quot; has two meanings before the fall of man: a) the helper of Adam (Gen 2:18) b) the part of Adam.(Gen 2:21) The primitive root word of woman (אִשָּׁה) is man ( אִישׁ ).The primitive root of man ( אִישׁ ) means to be weak, sick, frail. Initially, the difference between the woman and man is not determined by gender or sex but by its role and origin.</div>

<div p="1">The feature of gender first is exposed on woman after the fall of man during the judgment of God. &quot;Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception (הֵרָיוֹן); in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.&quot; (Gen3:16 KJV) For the first time, it shows that woman is different from man because woman contains the concept of conception (הֵרָיוֹן), born and pain and sin.</div>

<div p="1">In spite that the meaning and father and mother are not given in the immediate context, from the mirror of Adam and Eve, it can be concluded that father is like Adam or man, and mother is like woman. A clear role of father is not demonstrated until after the fall of man: the one who first began to live in a tent and raise cattle (Gen 4:20) and the one who first began to play the harp and flute (Gen 4:21) are entitled as &quot;father.&quot; In other word, father has the meaning of originator, creator and inventor.</div>

<div p="1">Originally, Eve is called woman by God (Gen 2:22). Before the fall of mankind, Adam also calls his helper as woman.(Gen 2:23). During the story of the fall of mankind, she is always called as woman. But after the fall of man and the judgment of God, Adam gives his woman a name Eve. (Gen 3:20) Eve means the Mother of all the living. (Gen 3:20) After Eve born the first child Cain (Gen 4:1), the name of Eve is not used any more in the OT. Cain becomes a murder lately. Although the name of Eve only appears twice in the OT, since then, human beings began to have a Mother.</div>

<div p="1">However, Adam did not call himself as the Father of all living. Hence, human beings did not have a Father until Jesus came into the world to call the Lord the heavenly Father. Only Jesus had the right to call the Lord the heavenly Father. Because in the eyes of the Son of man, the relationship between the Father and the Mother is not based on the gender nor sex but based on the Holy Spirit, the sovereignty, holiness and glory, based on the relationship between the creator and the createe, the lover and the lovee. The Father and the Mother are not in the same domain for equal rights. Only the heavenly Father is what human beings should worship and glorify.</div>

<div p="1">From a missiological view point, the four-members family is the mirror of the basic organization of church. Father and mother represent the missionaries, elders and leaders; man and woman represent the community and followers. The relationship between father and mother or man and woman is like the relationship between Jesus and His people. The purpose of family is originally designed for the advent missionary. The filial piety in the ten commandments is actually from the missiological purpose.</div>

<div p="1">After the fall of man, son and daughter, brother and sister are introduced into the family and are separated out from man and woman. They mirror the advent church community in OT and become clear in NT. After Jesus fufiled His mission through redemption, with His multiple sonships, the son of man and the only Son of the Heavenly Father, all sons and daughters of the Mother can return back to be the children of God.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div btitle="" p="1" refer1="https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-qa/god-and-man-as-male-and-female-implications-for-gender-identity/">(3) Why did God create male and female (Gen 1:27)?How differ in eyes of God?</div>

<div p="">Human beings classify themself into various types according to color, ethnicity, culture, nationality, age, education, social status, gender or sex, etc. But God initially only created two types of man according to His image and likeness: male and female. Human beings identify males and females based on gender or sex. For example, they identify a newborn baby primarily based on its sex organ. However, in the OT, there is no such word &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;gender&quot; in Hebrew. In the KJV, the closest meaning for &quot;gender&quot; is <em>raba</em> (רָבַע) in Hebrew, which means: to lie stretched out, lie down. (Lev 18:23, 19:19, 20:16)</div>

<div p="">According to what God said initially, &quot;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and overall the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&quot; (Gen 1:26) Man has no property of gender or sex. The image of God has no gender. Regarding the duties assigned to man, gender or sex is not necessary at all.</div>

<div p="1">However, according to what God did, &quot;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created them.&quot; (Gen 1:27) The word male and female suddenly appeared during the creation. Moreover, in Hebrew, the word male (זָכָר) and female (נְקֵבָה) are completely different and they have no any common ground at all. The word male (זָכָר) comes from a primitive root (זָכַר) that means &quot;to remember, recall, call to mind&quot; . The female (נְקֵבָה) comes from a primitive root (נָקַב) that means &quot;to pierce, perforate, bore, appoint; to curse, blaspheme.&quot;</div>

<div p="">It seems that what God said is different from what God did. However, this does not mean that God rebels against Himself. God is faithful God. (Duet 7:9) &quot;I will not alter the word that went forth from my lips&quot; (Psa 89:34) &quot;As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.&quot;(Isaiah 55:10-11) The difference between the saying and doing only means that the creation of man is finished, but ultimate goal of the creation is yet accomplished.</div>

<div p="">Based on what God said after He created man, it can be seen that the primary purpose to create male and female is to &quot;Be fruitfule and increase in number; fill the earth&quot; (Gen 1:28) Today human beings think that being fruitful and increasing in number is related to gender and sex. However, in the eyes of God, man are genderless or sex-free. God never said that Adam(אָדָם) is male and Eve (חַוָּה) is female. God called Eve as woman (אִשָּׁה). The word woman (אִשָּׁה) comes from the primitive root word man (אִישׁ), which means &quot;part of man.&quot; Eve is originally called woman. The name of Eve was given by Adam after the fall of man. The word man and woman, the male and female are two pairs of words. But man and male, woman and female are not connected in Hebrew until the circumcision appears (Gen 17:10)</div>

<div p="">The absence of sex in the Hebrew context indicated that the male and female are not determined by sex or gender. The purpose to create male and female is not to create two kinds of human beings based on the gender or sex. In the eyes of God, males and females are one humankind. The distinction between the male and female is the seal of God set on humankind to prepare for human beings to be able to distinguish between son and daughter, the savior and saviee.</div>

<div p="">From this perspective, it can be seen that, what God said to man (Gen 1:28) is exactly the same as what Jesus said to His disciples.(Mat 28:19-20) (a) &quot;God bless them (man)&quot; refers to &quot;Surely I(Jesus) will be with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot; (b) &quot;be fruitful&quot; means &quot;make disciples&quot;, (c) &quot;increase in number and fill the earth&quot; means &quot;throughout all nations and baptizing (fill) them in name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot;, (d) &quot;subdue and rule over&quot; means &quot;teach them to obey everything I (Jesus) have commanded you.&quot; Jesus&#39; Great Commission is not something new but the command of God when man was created in the beginning. The distinction between male and female is the distinction between son and daughter, the Son and man, the disciples and the Gentiles. In the eyes of God, human beings have only two kinds: Christian and non-Christian, like sheep and goat (Mat 25:32)</div>

<div p="1">In a word, male and female are not the trouble makers leading to adultery or pain; instead, God created male and female to prepare for the Son of God to fulfill the salvation plan.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(4) Why is Jesus the Son of the God?</div>

<div>As it is the created beings and it is filled with sin, it is hard for mankind to believe in Jesus Christ--the super-center of the universe. It has to be a progressive process under the revelation of God from the OT to the NT, first, to know the concept of human son, then to trace up to the heavenly Father and finally to be able to perceive the Holy Spirit. However, to better understand the Son of God, it would have to discuss it through a way of the Trinity.</div>

<div>As the number of generations is getting more and more, it&#39;s getting harder and harder to trace back the ancestors; people who know ancestors becomes less and less. Accordingly the innate capability of knowing God is getting weaker and weaker until it was totally lost when Jesus came. The simple relationship between the Son and the Father is a shortcut for the long and broken lineage from the individual, to parents, to grandparents, to all ancestors, to Adam, and to God.</div>

<div>Jesus is a son of man. Not all people love their parents, but all people love children even they rebel. (Mat 7:9-10) In many cultures such as China and India, to have a child, especially a boy, is considered as auspicious sign in family life. Usually, people prefer children over their parents. Children are the hope and future of parents. As long as children have a bright future, parents would not concern their bitterness and desperation and death. Abraham&#39;s top desire from God is to have a boy. Parents could get proud if their children are extraordinary. These human natures make it easy for man to allow Jesus to come into life. Jesus is a son man. Everyone can have Jesus since He is the Son of man to allow freely to adopt. As a son of man, Jesus will never make those who adopt him disappointed. The story of Jesus is the story of the son of man. Everyone who has Jesus has everything&mdash;the glory of the Father, the love of God, the hope of future, the eternal life. &quot;Whoever has the Son has the eternal life; whoever does not have the Son does not have the eternal life&quot; (1John 5:12)</div>

<div>Not all people can experience the parenthood, but all can experience childhood. The son of man is a purified paradigm that has all nature of all children. Jesus can be understood by all people without high level of education. Jesus is not a superman who merely makes people admirable. He is the one that everyone can follow him. Jesus is weaker and poorer than all children. &quot;A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,&quot; (Mat12:20 NIV) Everyone can follow Him as long as he is willing.</div>

<div>Jesus is not only the son of man but also the Son of God. He has all properties of both the children and the son of Father. Since the Son of God inherits all properties from God, hence, Jesus also has all properties both children and God. Everyone who follows Him can reach God. Man can only reach God through Him. God can only save man through Him. God&#39;s redemption plan can only be fulfilled through Him. Jesus said, &quot;No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; (Jhn14:6 ESV)</div>

<div>In theory, son and father are two completely separated concepts, but in reality, a son and a father cannot be divided at anytime at all. &quot;The Father would not be Father unless he had a Son, and the Son would not be Son unless he has a Father.&quot;<sup pg="66" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> &quot;He was with God in the beginning.&quot; (Jhn1:2 NIV) When a person can switch focus from a worldly son to Jesus Christ, he is able to see the heavenly Father. Jesus said, &quot;Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.&quot; (Jhn14:9 ESV) If a person did not know Jesus, he could not know the Father. Jesus said, &quot;You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&quot; (Jhn 8:19 ESV) Between the Son and the Father, it is much easier for human beings to understand a son than God. As the human lineage is getting longer and longer, the capability to know God is weaker and weaker until totally lost. As a matter of fact, human beings cannot see or understand God directly at all because He is holy.</div>

<div>To have Jesus as the son of man is not to be the father of the son. Instead, to have the son of man is to learn from the son and to return back to be like a son and to follow the spirit of the son. Following needs a correct direction. To follow the son of man is not to imitate the childish enthusiasm, a childish outburst, naive temper, looks or behaviors but about the Holy Spirit. Children need to grow up not just physically in body, but more essentially in spirit to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Jesus said: &quot;I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (Mat18:3 NIV) What Jesus implied is about the properties of children who are the poor spirit, those who mourn, the meek, hunger and thirst not for the bread and milk but for the righteousness, who are merciful, pure in heart, the peacemakers, malstreated because of the righteousness. (Mat 5:1-10)</div>

<div>A difference between the Son and the Father is that the Son inherits the Father rather than that the Father inherits the Son. &quot;The Son is the Son because he is begotten from the Father and proceeds from the Father by way of generation.&quot; <sup pg="65" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> &quot;The Father is the Father because he is the unbegotten&quot;<sup pg="54" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> The Son is the son of the Father, he is not the son of the Holy Spirit; the Father is the father of the Son, he is not the father of the Holy Spirit. However, both the Son and the Father share the same Holy Spirit. The Son and the Father are idential in that the Son inherits everything from the Father in the Holy Spirit.</div>

<div>On the basis of an understanding of human begetting, analogous content can be derived in applying the term &#39;generation&#39; <sup pg="65" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> It seems in the world that the Son is the next generation of the Father. The Father is the first, the Son is the second. It is in compliance with the relationship between man and the Lord, the createe and the creator. However, in the kingdom of heaven, there is no time, no history, no space, no logic, no grammatical tense(past, present and future). Jesus said, &quot;Heaven and earth will pass away,&quot; (Mak13:31 NIV) &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot; (Rev22:13 ESV) &quot;But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.&quot; (Mat19:30 NIV) The Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end, are all in one.</div>

<div>If the Son&#39;s Holy Spirit is considered as the only Way for man to seek God, then the Father&#39;s Holy Spirit is the ultimate destination that is the perpetual Truth. The bondage between the Son&#39;s Father and the Father&#39;s Son, which is the love(agape) of God, is essentially the deployed eternal life. Jesus said that &quot;I am the Way, the Truth and the Life&quot; (John 14:6) What Jesus said about the Way, the Truth and the Life is essentially the same as the trinity (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit) but in a a human understandable expression. Unless to intoduce the concept of trinity, otherwise, Jesus, the Son of the heavenly Father, cannot be well articulated and understood.</div>

<div>From a perspective of a state, if the only Way of man in the world is considered as the Liberty, the truth that man seek is the happiness, then what the Son and the Father bring about is the everlasting human life. This leads to the United States Decaration of Independence (1776): &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evidece, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&mdash;that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...&quot;</div>

<section>
<div p="1">Huiosology will discuss the son independently but from various perspectives and approaches including OOM. The attribute of son includes: ontology, parents, gender, age, personality, born, life (new, eternal), righteousness.</div>

<div p="1">OOM is a method based on the observation of the organization of the world -- the world is composed of various types of numerous objects. Its successful application in software industry can help to prove that OOM is an appropriate approach that fit the nature. It could be a way of how God created the world. At least OOM did not contradict in any perspective to the Genesis about the creation of the world. OOM has already been applied in ontology, biology, liguistics and many other disciples. To apply OOM into theology is still relatively new<sup pg="chap2" title="GrahamHarman2018book">[]</sup>. But this paper finds that applying OOM into huiosology not only can better understand the biblical meaning of son but also can simplify the discussion about the huiosology. 1. Gender neutrality. 2. relationship based. 3. perspective of ontology (study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality. It is part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics.)</div>

<div subpagesize="0.5"><a id="uid16" name="uid16" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Gender of &quot;Son&quot;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1"><a>Gender&nbsp;is a significant harassment for people to better understand the Son of man, the Son of God and the heavenly Father.&nbsp; As soon as a person enters into the puberty around teenage, the sex&nbsp;will began to affect his life until his death. In today&#39;s society, the happiness, the social status, the career, the wealthy, the healthy, the sin/crimals, the faith or&nbsp;the fate of life are all directly or indirectly related to&nbsp;sex. The top&nbsp;popular sin&nbsp;of US&nbsp;is not the idoltry, murder or&nbsp;steal but the adultery. When the concept of son comes into the mind, the first sense for people today&nbsp;is about the&nbsp;male sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></div>

<div p="1">In the OT, there is no such word &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;gender&quot; in Hebrew. In the KJV, the word that was translated as&nbsp;&quot;gender&quot; is <em>raba</em> (רָבַע)&nbsp;in Hebrew, which means: to lie stretched out, lie down. (Lev 18:23, 19:19, 20:16). In NT, the word that was translated as &quot;gender&quot; is gennao (&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;ά&omega;) in Greek, it means I. of men who fatherred children, to be bron, to be begotten. II. metaph, to engender, cause to arise, excite. Of God making Chrrist his son, or making men his sons through faith in Christ&#39;s work. (2Tim 2:23)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Although&nbsp;there is no concept of gender and sex in the Bible, the term of male (זָכָר,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen34">zakar</em>) and female (נְקֵבָה,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen40">neqebah</em>) began to appear&nbsp;as early as in the creation time (Gen1:27).&nbsp; The root word of female (נְקֵבָה,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen40">neqebah</em>) comes from (נָקַב,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen43">naqab) which means I.</em>to pierce, perforate, bore, appoint and II.&nbsp;to curse, blaspheme, which has nothing to do with sex.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">When God create the first man Adam (Gen 2:7), God did not mention if Adam is male or female. When God made the first woman from Adam, the attribute of woman is the helping, which is not&nbsp;associated sex male or female. Adam called his helper as woman because she was made from him, not because of the gender or sex.&nbsp; After the fall of man, Adam called his helper as Eve, because Eve would become the mother of all the living, not because of the sex. When Eve became pregnant and gave&nbsp;birth (4:1), the character of woman Eve became clear: woman is made of man, the helper of man, the&nbsp;labor of child. However, the sex&nbsp;is still not associated with woman -- it is still not clear if man or woman is male or female.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The sexual related sin is adultery (נָאַף, naaph, x31, to commit adultery), is one of the ten commandment (Exo&nbsp;20:14) In Greece, adultery (&mu;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&epsilon;ύ&omega;, moicheuo)</div>
