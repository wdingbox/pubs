<div p="1">The concept of &#39;son&#39; (Greek: &upsilon;&iota;ό&sigmaf;, huios) plays a special role in the Gospel: Jesus frequently called Himself as &#39;the Son of Man&#39; and referred himself &#39;the Son of God&#39;; God called Jesus as &#39;My Beloved Son&#39;(Matthew 3:17). The word&nbsp;&quot;son&quot; is a title used for specific&nbsp;type of relative member&nbsp;in human family tree. To entitle&nbsp;Jesus as son can raise&nbsp;many questions for both Christians and non-Christians: Is the meaning of &#39;Son&#39; in Christology the same as what people think of family tree in the world? If different, how much differ between the two? What is the theological meaning of &#39;son&#39;? Is it a parable or metaphor of genre? What is the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in eyes of Jesus Christ? Why is Jesus called the Son of Man and the Son of God? Has any other word that can substitute &#39;son&#39;? These questions composed the displine of study as huiosology, which will not only affect Christians how more precisely comprehend the Gospel but also for missionaries and non-Christians about&nbsp;the view of matrimony and other tipics including how to seek personal happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<!---- Unless this "son" refers to the advent Son of God, who is Jesus Chris, the meaning of "son" would perpetually be a mystery. All myths of the son comes from the traditional misinterpretation in the group of the seven sons.  While understanding the craftiness of evil, the evidence also shows the sinfulness of man—God already have equally revealed His Son over the land of China, but its people keep rejecting and mutating. ------->

</div>

<div subpagesize="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The word &#39;son&#39; (Greek: &upsilon;&iota;ό&sigmaf;, huios) is one of the highly&nbsp;frequently used meaningful nouns in the NT&nbsp;(top in OT, 8th in NT)&nbsp;[]. People have no problem to understand it&nbsp;genealogically or biologically.&nbsp; However, when the NT claims that Jesus is &#39;the Son of God&#39;, and when Jesus&nbsp;called Himself as &#39;the son&#39; and&nbsp;&#39;the Son of Man&#39;, it strands many, especially for the non-believers.</div>

<div p="1">Historical theologians and scholars have spent significant time on the&nbsp;debate of the trinity, especially in the first five hundred years. Although the&nbsp;topics covers the sonship, the discussion&nbsp;mainly focuses&nbsp;on the union of the three (Father, Son and Spirit). After the Reformation, more and more research began to narrow down on &#39;the son of man&#39; and &#39;the son of God&#39;, whereas, the study mainly limited in&nbsp;scopes where&nbsp;the phrases defined. Rare documents in the western history can be found so far that&nbsp;takes the word of &#39;son&#39; as a solitary target for broadly reseach.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">One reason could be that the conept of &#39;son&#39; is too simple for them to deserve to discuss -- it is meaningless to study it if it is disconnected to the Gospels.&nbsp;Another reason could be that the&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;concept of&nbsp;&#39;son&#39; was rooted&nbsp;so deeply in a culture&nbsp;that no other concept can be tolerated to come in. To orient the origin of &#39;son&#39; in a&nbsp;culture usually would end with the clueless.</div>

<div p="1">There is no doubt that better understanding the meaning of &#39;son&#39; can help to better construe&nbsp;the phrase &quot;the son of man&quot; and &quot;the Son of God.&quot; Indeed, it is critical to solve those theological issues since &#39;son&#39; is an atomic element that cannot be replaced by any other words in christology. i.e. &#39;the son of God&#39; cannot be replaced by &#39;the child of God&#39; or &#39;the daughter of God&#39; because God in person called Jesus as &#39;My Beloved Son&#39;(Mat3:17, Mat17:5),&nbsp;&quot;Out of Egypt I called my son&quot;&nbsp;(Mat2:15).&nbsp;Besides, Jesus called God as &nbsp;&#39;Father&#39; for about seventy times in the Gospels.&nbsp;In christological sonship relationship between Jesus and God,&nbsp;&#39;son&#39; cannot be&nbsp;pararell to &#39;child&#39; or &#39;daughter&#39; to&nbsp;belong to a same class as it is in literature as an offspring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">However, it can be found in the paper that, to dig into the concept of &#39;son&#39; to see if there is a biblical meaning over the traditional literal definition, is complicated and&nbsp;related to many diciplines. To simplify this, it&#39;s necessary to&nbsp;define&nbsp;a term huiosolgy (hwee-o-sology)&nbsp;to put all knowledge related to &#39;son&#39; together to faciliate scholars for systematic research.&nbsp;Such kind of methodology has already been used in theology, for&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">example:</span></div>

	<li>Christology &ndash; The study of Christ</li>
	<li>Paterology(Theology proper) - the study of the Father or the character of God</li>
	<li>Soteriology &ndash; The study of salvation</li>
	<li>Angelology &ndash; The study of angels</li>
	<!----      https://www.gotquestions.org/Bibliology.html -->
	<li>Bibliology(Biblical theology) &ndash; The study of the canonical Bible, the Word of God</li>
	<li>Ecclesiology &ndash; The study of the church</li>
	<li>Eschatology &ndash; The study of the end times</li>
	<li>Hamartiology &ndash; The study of sin</li>
	<li>Pneumatology &ndash; The study of the Holy Spirit</li>
	<li>Theological anthropology &ndash; The study of the nature of humanity.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div p="1">
<div>Huiosology can be considered as a branch of Christology to study the &#39;sonship&#39; of Jesus to&nbsp;particulary solve the following issues commonly&nbsp;raised among non-believers:</div>

<div>(1) Is the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in christology the same as in&nbsp;cultural literature? If different, how much differ between the two? Is &quot;son&quot; in christology used as the parable/metaphor of genre? If so, has any other words or concepts&nbsp;that can substitute &#39;son&#39; without changes of the original meaning? if not, what is the theological meaning of &#39;son&#39;?</div>

<div>(2) What is the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in eyes of Jesus Christ and God? What is the biblical meaning of &#39;son&#39;? Why did God call Jesus as &#39;the Son&#39;? Why did God send a &#39;son&#39; rather than a &#39;daughter&#39; for redemption?</div>
</div>

<div p="1">With such clear boundares defined, huisology can help people to open mind&nbsp;to allow the modern ideaology in different disciplines&nbsp;to participate the research. In order to demonstrate such benifit, this paper applies&nbsp;Object-Oriented Method (OOM), a famous theory and methodology of&nbsp;computer science,&nbsp;to enrich the huiosological theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">While huisology can provide a more systematic and reliable theory&nbsp;to bridge&nbsp;people to better understand&nbsp;&#39;the son of man&#39;, &#39;the son of God&#39; as well as the&nbsp;trinity and other theological issues, huisology also can&nbsp;make it easier to rebuke&nbsp;the heresy, like Darwin&#39;s evolution theory, &ldquo;the divine Mother&#39; heresy&nbsp;and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Although the theology oriented in the west and is the richest in history, huisology is a blank. A.</div>

<div p="1"><strong>In the East</strong></div>

<div p="1">The earliest document related to huisology study can be found in a book of Chinese offiical Bibliography of Seven Areas (七略).&nbsp;Probably it was written by Chinese scholar Liu Xiang 刘向 (77BC-6AD).&nbsp;one of the seven Areas is called the various-huis&nbsp;(诸子略). If the information can be verified, the collected&nbsp;documents&nbsp;can be considered as the eariest huisological study&nbsp;in human history. Ironically, China does not have theologians until twenty century, like Protestant theological thinkers T. C. Chao (1888-1979), Chinese theologian Wu Leichuan(1870-1944), Taiwanese Shoki Coe (1914-1988) and so on.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">In Book of New Tang (新唐书, 1060-1127), classic books are divided into four parts, one of which is called huios part. (新唐书.艺文志一: &ldquo;两都各聚书四部，以甲乙丙丁为次，列经史子集四库。&rdquo;) In the huios part, it contains the works of Confucius, Daois, Moism, Legalism and so on.</div>

<div p="1">In Book of Four Warehouses (SiKu Quanshu 四庫全書, accomplished in 1782) and the Bibliography of Chinese Classics (中国古籍总目, published in 2013), the huios is always listed in the third among the four parts.</div>

<div p="1">There is no historical documents articulating why huios was used as a category in Chinese classic documents. Also, there is no text particularly discussing about the huios. However, term of &#39;huios part&#39;, which is used for the categorization of classics, can be considered as the earliest prototype of huiosology.</div>

</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid2" name="uid2" subpage_idx="">3.</a>Significance of&nbsp; the Study</div>

<div p="1">In theory, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are three different terminologies for three different concepts. However, in reality, they are in one of triune and cannot be seperated. Moreover, the Son is Jesus; the Father is God. Whenever the Son is mentioned, it means the Father (God), the Spirit, Jesus Christ at the same time. Son and Jesus, Father and God&nbsp;are interchangable in the Bible due to their one to one unique relationship. It is due to the sin and human limitation that a man can only catch one at a time in a serial way rather than a parellel way. When man discuss one of them, he is subject to forget others. These&nbsp;factors make people difficult to understand or express the biblical meaning of the Son.</div>

<div p="1">Historical theologians studied the huios from perspectives of the Father and the Spirit. With such method, they seperated the Father (God) and the Spirit from the trinity to formulate the theories for Peterology and Pneumatology. But they rarely seperated huios from triune and studied it independently. Some studied the huios from perspective of theological anthropology. There are peterology, Pneumatology and anthropology but not huiosology. These factors make the study of huios very limited. To study the huios independently can help better to better understand the trinity.</div>

<div p="1">From a missiological viewpoint, it is easier for atheists to believe in God or Jesus as an individual than to belive in the only Son of God as Jesus Christ. The theological material is rich in Peterology, Christology and Pneumatology. However, it is a barren field for pastors and missionaries to preach about the son. Some may think that the meaning of son is self-explanation in our daily life. Everyone knows what is son. As matter of fact, people understand son It is such barrier that blocks many people to smoothly come to the triune Jesus.</div>

<div p="1">The term Object-Oriented (OO) was originally initiated in Artificial Intelligence engineering area in late 1950&#39;s <sup title="McCarthyJBraytonR1960">[]</sup>. The word &quot;oriented&quot; comes from the verb &quot;orient&quot; which means: <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dataversity.net%2Fa-short-history-of-ontology-its-not-just-a-matter-of-philosophy-anymore%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DEtymologically%2520the%2520term%2520ontology%252C%2520like%2Cthe%2520early%252017th%2520century.%20%2D%2D%3E-->

<ul>
	<li>to begin with reference to a real object observed in the world.</li>
	<li>to direct or position toward that particular object programmed.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div p="">Object-Oriented Methodology (OOM) became popular first in software industry in 1990&#39;s. In computer science, Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &quot;object&quot;, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</div>

<div p="">The core idea is based on the observation that the world, from micro to macro, is composed of objects. Each object is a relatively independent living instance that has its own feature including static property (attribute or characteristic, traits, attributes) and dynamic behavior (or functionality, procedures) two parts. Also, it can be observed that different objects may share the same or similar property and behavior. Objects that have the identical property and behavior are classified as a type. With such worldview, it can be proposed that the world is composed of various types of numerous objects.</div>

<div p="">From a software programming perspective, property and behavior are two different things: property is the data of collected information whileas behavior is the calculation of process transaction. To collect and identify the data for property is a tremendous job that is different from the complicated algorithm based calculation required for behavior or functionality. Earlier programmers tend to think and handle data and calculation in two isolated memory spaces.</div>

<div p="">Object-Oriented Methodology (OOM) is based on a philosophy that property and behavior are indivisible. In theory, property and behavior are two different areas and can be studied seperatedly, however, in reality, property and behavior cannot exist independly. For example, a life with feminine property always appears and acts in female behavior. OOM suggests that programmers should consider the object as the basic unit in programming rather than data and operation. They should encapulate or wrap both property and behavior into object so that they can focus on the objects and their relationship in any project. OOM is a way just like the process that people observe and describe about the world. To distinguish OOM to any other method in software engineering, OOM provides following basic concepts and theroies: <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2DThe%20so-called%20class%20is%20the%20classified%20abstracted%20%22object%22%20according%20to%20its%20type.%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20The%20data%20is%20also%20called%20%22property%22%2C%20the%20algorithm%20is%20also%20called%20%22method%22%2C%20%22interface%22%2C%20or%20%22function%22%20to%20represent%20internal%20calculation%20process.%2D%2D%3E--> <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%25Such%20formulation%20process%20from%20objects%20to%20classes%20is%20called%20abstration.%20%2D%2D%3E--></div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(1) Type vs Class</div>

<div p="">Type is the common features of objects with the same charactacterics, including both static properties and dynamic behaviors, which can distinguish itself to others as in a category. In theory, the number of features is unlimited. In practice, only limited but essential features, which is called &#39;class&#39; in programming, can be collected to represent its type of objects.</div>

<div p="1">The process to identify a type from objects, or to define a class from a type, is called the abstraction. Abstraction is essentially a human intellectual cognition. Hence, type or class only exists in human mind, whereas object exists in real world.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(3) Inheritance vs Heredity</div>
<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%20%5Csubsection%7BInheritance%20and%20Heredity%7D%20%2D%2D%3E-->

<div p="">Although two types of objects are different in categorization, they still may share some common features. Ape and man are example. Indeed, any two types of objects, no matter how different they are, there alway can be found some common features between the two. All object composing the world are connected in terms of identities of features.</div>

<div p="">Inheritance:</div>

<div p="">To better understand the relationship among different types according to their similarity, OOM introduces a concept of inheritance. For similicity, assuming two different classes B and C, if class C has all features of class B, then it is said that class C inherits features from class B. There exists an inheritance relationship between B and C. Class B is called the parent class (or base or root class). Class C is called child class.</div>

<div p="">There are three kinds of inheritance: single (a child class inherits only one parent), multiple (a child class inherits multiple parent) and virtual inheritance (a child class inherits parent&#39;s virtual functions). With a well OOD, an application program contains single inheritance only and there exists a top root class.</div>

<div p="">Heredity:</div>

<div p="">Literally, there is no essential difference in meaning between inheritance and heredity. They are interchangable in many cases. However, in this paper, heredity denotes that the transmission of features from an object to its cloned object. The original object is called the parent object. The cloned object is called the child object. The child object can be the whole or part of parent object. After the clone, the parent and child objects can have its own status different to each other. In OOM, the significant difference between the inheritance and heridity is that, inheritance can change types at design-time space, whileas heridity can only change the status at run-time space.</div>

<div p="">Application</div>

<div p="">Understanding the difference between the inheritance and heredity is important to rebuke the Darwin&#39;s evolution theory. The similarity between ape and man is due to inheritances occuring at design-time. There are three possible inheritances: A) man inherits ape. B) ape inherits man. C) ape and man inherit a virutal class. However, the similarity between a father and his son is due to heridity occuring at run-time. The two similarities are essentially differ to each other. A child differs to its parents in apparents (states of feature) but not in feature. Since run-time execution never interferes the design-time process. The offspring of ape, no matter how much it diffes to its ancestor through generations, will never change its type to become man.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(4) Encapsulation</div>
<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%20%5Csubsection%7B%20Encapsulation%7D%20%2D%2D%3E-->

<div p="">The interaction among oobjects is accomplished through the property information exchange and the reaction of the behavior interface. There exist rules of permission to access proptery information and behavior interface. For example, in C++, there are three level of permission: public, protected and private. The public property or behavior is allowed both to access at run-time and inherit at design-time. The protected feature is only allowed to inherit at the design-time. The private feature is not allowed to access at run-time or to inherits at design-time.</div>

<div p="">In OOM, encapsulation essentially is a set of permission rules defined at the design-time, and it cannot be changed at run-time. The protected and private features of objects are not accessible at run-time -- it leads to information hiding, which is good for security and reliability. On the other hand, information hiding could confuse people to understand the objects in the real world. It is likely due to the information hiding that People could not find the essential difference between ape and man.</div>

<div p="">In society, information hiding is way how people interact each other.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(5) Polymorphism</div>
<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%20%5Csubsection%7BPolymorphism%7D%20%2D%2D%3E-->

<div p="">In OOM, polymorphism refers to those behaviors of objects, that are conceptually the same but transact differently for different signatures. For example, rectangle with width and hight is different from the triangle with lengths of three sides in signature. However, the behaviors to get the area of them are conceptually the same, though their calcuation methods are different.</div>

<div p="">Two objects are the same type (class) if and only if they have the same property and behavior including the polymorphism and encapsulation.</div>

<div p="">In the natural world, polymorphism is usually subtle and difficult to identify. Sometimes, it is considered as a kind of mutation or the flexiable or adaptive capability of a type of objects. For example, some turtles are carnivores, while others follow a strictly vegetarian diet. The different foods for the digestion system could be a kind of polymorphism.</div>

<h3 chapter="I" pagesize="1"><a chpnum="" id="uid11" name="uid12">III. </a> Significance of&nbsp;OOM in Theology</h3>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">1.</a> In Ontology</div>

<div p="">At least, there are three important features in OOM that can influence people to re-think the meaning of &#39;son&#39; in human culture.</div>

<div p="">(1) The concept of child class in OOM is identical to the genealogical and biological concept of &#39;child&#39; in human&nbsp;culture in&nbsp;that both possess&nbsp;inheritance and heredity characteristic.</div>

<div p="">(2) The concept of child class in OOM is neutral without sex or gender. Male or&nbsp;female is just&nbsp;a property value of an object in&nbsp;runtime. In another word, it is not appropriate to consider male and female as two classes in OOM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(3) OOM can clearly articulate the difference between the child class and instance of child class.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">These three features can help people to re-think the concept of &#39;son&#39; in a ontological way. While keeping&nbsp;its literal meaning, the OOM can help people to open mind to transcend the traditional sexual way&nbsp;in its culture to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;the meaning of &#39;son&#39; used to describe Jesus&nbsp;&#39;the son of man&#39; or &#39;the Son of&nbsp;&nbsp;God&#39; in&nbsp;a spiritual way.&nbsp; It also help to better understand how God define the term of&nbsp;&#39;son&#39; in a bibilical&nbsp;way.</div>

<div p="">Ontology is&nbsp;a branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality. It&nbsp;deals with questions about what things exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped according to similarities and differences. Metaphysics is a&nbsp;branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space. OOM cannot be considered as a theory or philosophy but rather it is a methodolgy comes from ontology and metaphysics. OOM makes the theory and philosphy about &#39;being&#39; and &#39;which is&#39; simpler by&nbsp;distingushing the concepts bewteen&nbsp;&#39;class&#39; and &#39;object&#39;, which&nbsp;can be simulated through computer programming in run-time and design-time. With such limited human programming experiences, it make it possible for human beings to be able to understand that&nbsp;the round trip between two exclusive worlds is possible for Jesus -- Jesus is both &#39;the son of man&#39; and &#39;the son of God.&#39;&nbsp; To express it literally with&nbsp;articles, Jesus is both &#39;the Son&#39; and &#39;Son.&#39;</div>

<div p="">One of beauties&nbsp;of OOM in software industry is that program&nbsp;can esaily&nbsp;initiate unlimited number of harmony instances&nbsp;in run-time without duplication effort for human&nbsp;in design-time. The successfulness of OOM in software engineering&nbsp;with unlimited capability to simulate the world, more or less demonstrates that OOM could be a way of how God created the world. When God created the living things, which is more sophiscated than non-living things, He used the phrase &#39;according to their kinds&#39; for ten times&nbsp;(Gen1:11, Gen1:12, 1:21, 1:24,1:25). Each inidivual living object is unique. God did not create all of them one by one, instead, God made them in a way that they can freely procreate according to the types (classes) that God had pre-defined. God confirmed that &quot;it is good.&quot;</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">2.</a> In Creationism</div>

<div p="1">Creationism is a belief&nbsp; and worldview that the cusmos, living organism and&nbsp;life and all things originate by specific work of divine creator&nbsp;rather than from estranged natural processes such as evolution. Creationism takes in the biblical account,&nbsp;particularly the early chapters of Genesis, as literally true guides to the history of the universe and to the history of life, including us humans, down here on earth.<sup title="CreationismStanfordEncyclopediaofPhilosophy2018web">[]</sup>&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">From the pattern of the six-day creation in Genesis 1,&nbsp;it can be found&nbsp;that two words are euqlly most significant:&nbsp;said (אָמַר amar) and saw (רָאָה, raah). In each of the six days, the creation&nbsp;always starts with amar&nbsp;before things were created; the creation always ends with the word raah after things were create, except the air of sky&nbsp;that is invisible in the second day.&nbsp;The God&#39;s creation is actually&nbsp;a process of that&nbsp;what God&nbsp;said became what God&nbsp;saw. In another word, it is a saying-seeing transformation process.&nbsp;God&#39;s&nbsp;saying is different from calling or naming (קָרָא <em>qara</em>)&nbsp;that is a description of existing things. In God&#39;s creation, the saying represents what God wanted, it is the will of God, the&nbsp;result of cognition and thinking process.&nbsp;Whereas, seeing represets the accomplishment of what God created.&nbsp;Creationism believes that what God created or made visible or invisible is the world people can percieve&nbsp;today.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">With OOM terminology, saying and seeing in the God&#39;s creation&nbsp;can be further understood as&nbsp;domain transition process from the design-time to run-time. What God said in the beginning of each day is what God accomplished in design time. What God saw or finished&nbsp;are&nbsp;the objects of what God initiated&nbsp;in run-time.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">To be able to understand God&#39;s creation&nbsp;through the saying in run-time and seeing in design-time is not thorough&nbsp;enough. It is also important to know that, in God&#39;s creation, the saying in design-time and seeing in run-time always perfectly match and cannot go across&nbsp;to each other.&nbsp;The perfect match between the thinking and seeing is originally defined as &quot;good&quot; in Genesis. &quot;Un-crossable&quot; means that the design-time and run-time cannot communicate or negotiate each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;To emphasize the importance of such perfect match and inaccessiblity between the two, God signified&nbsp;the seventh day&nbsp;as sabbath. God not only blessed the sabbath but also&nbsp;sanctified&nbsp;it (Gen 2:3). The word sanctification (קָדַשׁ, qadash)&nbsp;means to consecrate, to set apart,&nbsp;to be&nbsp;holy, to be hallowed. But before the fall of man, it originally means inaccessble&nbsp;between the two.&nbsp;Sabbath&nbsp;not only represents the perfect match and &nbsp;inaccessiblility&nbsp;between the design-time and the run-time, between&nbsp;what the Lord said and what the Lord saw, but also represents in the vast array (Gen 2:1) and the&nbsp;inaccessible division between the heaven and the earth. While the creation of the earth&nbsp;was finished in six days, the creation of heaven also was accomplished and they are in all their vast array (Gen 2:1). &nbsp;Sabbath is a seal of what God said and what God saw in creation,&nbsp;which theologically means that the goodness, the justice and the will of God will never change.</div>

<div p="1">Although Sabbath is not part of the physical&nbsp;creation, and&nbsp;often ignored by creationism, Sabbath is not only the indivisible part of the God&#39;s creation but also&nbsp;spiritually&nbsp;more important than the six day creation process, since the Lord of Sabbath&nbsp;is the Son of God, who hold the key and can&nbsp;cross forth and back&nbsp;between heaven and earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The similarity of OOM&nbsp;and creationism can help atheism&nbsp;not only to better understand that God created&nbsp;the world, but also&nbsp;to clearly explain&nbsp;how God created the world. The significant difference between&nbsp;OOM and creationism is that, in God&#39;s creation, the saying and seeing alway perfect match and cannot cross each other because of&nbsp;Sabbath. Whereas in OOM, thinking and seeing can never perfectly match and there is no eternal will. The dismatch between the design-time and run-time is&nbsp;called bug in OOM or sin in theology.&nbsp;</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">3.</a> In Dual Kingdoms Doctrine</div>

<div p="1">The dual kingdoms Doctrine is based on the dual cities model first proposed by Augustine of Hippo (354-430) in his book &quot;The City of God&quot;. From Adam to the end of time, humanity falls into two cities: the mass of the godless, who live the life of earthly men; and the company of spiritual men, born of grace and called to the City of God for all eternity. The Worldly City, said Augustine, is united by the common love for temporal things. The City of God is bound together by the love of God. Augustine considered the church the only human community that worked for the building of the City of God. The state had its place in suppressing crime and preserving peace, but since the state was based on the power of sin, it must submit to the laws of the Christian church.<sup pg="pp. 139-140" title="BruceLShelley2008">[]</sup> <!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D-%20Shelley%2C%20Dr.%20Bruce%20L..%20Church%20History%20in%20Plain%20Language%3A%20Fourth%20Edition%20(pp.%20139-140).%20Thomas%20Nelson.%20Kindle%20Edition.%20%2D%2D%3E--></div>

<div p="1">Protestants (like John Calvin, Martin Luther) developed and enriched the dual cities model doctrine. Luther describes as the two kingdoms in some places as, &quot;two governments&quot;, &quot;two different powers&quot; or &quot;two different ways of reigning&quot; or &quot;two kinds of righteousness&quot;. One kingdom is called the kingdom of law for man or old Adam. The other is called the kingdom of Grace. to teach how to distinguish law and gospel. Luther taught that the world is divided into true Christians and non-Christians, and that the sword is necessary to restrain evil committed by non-Christians. The spiritual kingdom, made up of true Christians, does not need the sword. Luther&#39;s distinction was adopted by John Milton and John Locke. Milton wrote A Treatise of Civil Power. Locke later echoed the &quot;two kingdoms&quot; doctrine: There is a twofold society, of which almost all men in the world are members, and from that twofold concernment they have to attain a twofold happiness; viz. That of this world and that of the other: and hence there arises these two following societies, viz. religious and civil. <sup note="[11" title="LordPeterKing1864book">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">From a perspective of OOM, human language can be generally classified into object-oriented and non-object-oriented two types of languages. The so-called object-oriented language means that the language has certain or strict grammar rules with forms to distintict the differrences in concepts between object and class in the&nbsp;expression.</div>

<div p="1">For example, in Indo-European languages, Semitic languages (only the definite article), and Polynesian languages, the&nbsp;grammar&nbsp;rule of article is specified to express the differences between object and class. In English, &nbsp;&#39;a&#39; or &#39;an&#39; is for infinitive article, &#39;the&#39; is for finitive article. Article is used to specifically refer to instance. Instance and class cannot mixed. &quot;I have a son&quot;. is about the relationship between objects. It is legal in grammar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">however, many of the world&#39;s major languages including: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, many Turkic languages, etc&nbsp;do not have concept of article in its grammar. It is legal in grammar to express like this: &quot;I have son&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div btitle="1" p="1">An Overview</div>

<div p="1">The evolution theory was initially proposed by Charles Darwin (1809--1882) to explain the reason of the similarity and distinction among various species and individuals&nbsp;in biological world. Today, Darwin&#39;s evolution theory&nbsp;has become a systematic&nbsp;philosophy about how to view the porcess of continuousness of life. Darwin pulished many books and&nbsp;research papers in his life including&nbsp;<em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em> (1839), <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (1859), <em>The Variation of Animal and Plants Underr Domestication&nbsp;</em>(1868),&nbsp;<em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&nbsp;</em>(1871), <em>The Expression of the Emotion in Man and Animals</em> (1872), <em>The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms</em> (1881) and&nbsp;so on.&nbsp;However, the most foundmental theory what Darwin wanted&nbsp;to convince people to believe is that:&nbsp;species is mutable. Darwin stated&nbsp;that &quot;I can entertain no doubt, ...&nbsp;that each species has been independently created&mdash;is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp;Darwin concluded that &quot;In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that ... might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species.&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">To support the&nbsp;idea, he proposed two critical hypothesis:</div>

<div p="1">(1)&nbsp;&quot;natural selection&quot; theory: the best fit between life and its condition of life will determine how and what species will be changed from one to another.&nbsp;Darwin&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that &quot;I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification [of species].&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp; Natural selection is a topic that is discussed most in his work, and that is the most complicated since it associates with almost all displines including biology, psychology, religion, society, moral, and so on.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">(2)&nbsp;&quot;unknown&quot; theory: Darwin openly claimed&nbsp;that there exists some unknown factor in his&nbsp;theory including&nbsp;the unknown origin of our Domestic Productions,&nbsp;the unknown laws of governing inheritance,&nbsp;the unknown law of variability and&nbsp;correlation of growth and so on. But he insisted that &quot;a<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">lthough much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure,&nbsp;</span>I can entertain no doubt,&quot; each speciesis descended from&nbsp;one or several parent-species,&nbsp;some of which &quot;now supposed to be extinct and unknown,&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">under some known or&nbsp;unknown favourable conditions with&nbsp;a certain unknown number of generations.<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;</span>In his light thrown on the origin of man and his history, he predicted&nbsp;that&nbsp;&quot;It has often and confidently been asserted, that man&#39;s origin can never be known.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;He concluded that &quot;This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Based on these, he finally declared that man is the result of evolution&nbsp;from&nbsp;lower species like monkey or ape&nbsp;through&nbsp;natural selection under a certain&nbsp;length of&nbsp;time and enviroment. &quot;The conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other species of some ancient, lower, and extinct form, is not in any degree new.&quot;<sup>[]</sup></div>

<div p="1"><strong>A Spiritual War</strong></div>

<div p="1">For more than hundred of years, Darwin&#39;s evolution theory did not bring any revolution in science and technology but significanly&nbsp;impacted the human faith and activities. It directly influenced Karl Marx (1818 &ndash;1883) to found&nbsp;scientific socialism and communism theory, and theoritically legalized the warlords to launch the world war I&amp;II for the sake of natural selection.&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s evolution theory is not soley&nbsp;a&nbsp;biological heypotheis&nbsp;but a spiritual war against the Chrsitian faith. Darwin wanted to convince&nbsp;that his newly discovered natural selection theory is a&nbsp;law above all. The ultimate purpose of all activities including cognition and all religions&nbsp;are driven by and for the law of natural selection in order to survive.&nbsp;In eyes of Darwin,&nbsp;&quot;There is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God.&quot;<sup>[2]&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;He stated that &quot;The feeling of religious devotion, ... consisting of love, complete submission to an exalted and mysterious superior, a strong sense of dependence, fear, reverence, gratitude, hope for the future, and perhaps other elements, ...&nbsp;is an emotion until advanced in his intellectual and moral faculties to at least a moderately high level [in natural selection]&quot;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;He quoted that &quot;a dog looks on his master as on a god.&quot;<sup>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;He challenged the authority of Genesis:&nbsp;&quot;Man, made in the image of God, was also made in the image of the ape.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Darwin considered Jesus&#39; teaching in Mat 7:12 and&nbsp;Luke 6:31&nbsp;is nothing but a result of natural selection in a form of morality. He stated that &quot;I have so lately endeavoured to shew that the social instincts,&mdash;the prime principle of man&#39;s moral constitution&mdash;with the aid of active intellectual powers and the effects of habit, naturally lead to the golden rule, &#39;As ye would that men should do to you, do ye to them likewise;&#39;&nbsp;and this lies at the foundation of morality.&quot;<strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></div>

<div p="1">Darwin thought the unselifish&nbsp;death for others as a&nbsp;kind of higher level of form in natural selection. He stated that &quot;When a man risks his life to save that of a fellow-creature, it seems more appropriate to say that he acts for the general good or welfare, rather than for the general happiness of mankind [in natural selection].&quot;<sup>[2]</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div p="1">Darwin&#39;s evolution theory was widely considered as&nbsp;one of greatest scientific discovery in history and is required&nbsp;in public school. Indeed, people are infleunced by&nbsp;the evolution theory not because&nbsp;of&nbsp;its&nbsp;mutable species&nbsp;teaching but mainly because of its&nbsp;atheism faith. Grown up in a Christian family and graduated&nbsp;from a&nbsp;famous Christian college (University of Cambridge), Darwin&#39;s rebellions against Christian faith not only demonstrated the fall of the Western Christian culture but also the devolution of human spiritual life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1"><strong>Apologetics with OOM</strong></div>

<div p="1">Scientifically speaking, from the foundmental species mutability&nbsp;theory to the conclusion about the origin of man,&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s theory are wrong. Its natural selection theory contradict to the creationism and is a misleading.&nbsp;Many&nbsp;scientists or scholars disagree&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s theory from many aspects,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;for more than hundred of years, none of them could fully turn it over. There are many reasons.</div>

<div p="1">(1) Darwin was not able to distinguish the inheritance and herredity between the run-time space and design-tiem space. He errously applied the evolution phenonomina in&nbsp;the run-time space into species variation variation of design-time space, and wrongly think the species variation is time based run-time process. Evolution phenomena is common. For example, the language, technology, and human civilization&nbsp;etc. are all the time based evolution process. &quot;every language bears the marks of its slow and gradual evolution.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;On the other hand, devolution phenomena is also common. Natural ecosystem, polution, human spirit, and so on are time-based process getting worse and worse. In Amerian, from Puritianism that pursues&nbsp;the truth but brought the prospeirty, to the Osteenism that pusues the prosperity and will lead to ruin, is also a sample of devolution.&nbsp;In darwin&#39;sm, what is advance and retreat are not clearly and cannot clearly defined. The complixity cannot be considered as advanced, it could the chaos. The simplest cannot be considered as the primitive, restreated. Indeed, truth has to be simple. All principles of nature found is the simplest rule of the complicated world.&nbsp;It&#39;s easy for people to confuse if a software application update is design-time or a run-time process. People are subject&nbsp;to confuse between inheritance and heredity.&nbsp;Syncritism is one of the common caft arts to allure people spiritually. Darwin&#39;s evolution theory itself is a good evidence of the fall of man.</div>

<div p="1">(2) Darwin&#39;s evolution theory was widely considered as a scientific theory since it was built&nbsp;upon facts&nbsp;with more than five thousands of his collected plant and animal specimens, more than a thousand pages of his geological observations, as well as data collected by other scientists. However, overview Darwin&#39;s work,&nbsp; it is nothing but the facts without new creative point,&nbsp;it is full of mental thinking without spiritual spark, it is not inspiring&nbsp;but misleading, it is not joying with&nbsp;peace&nbsp;but worrying to be unselected. Darwin&#39;s collected facts&nbsp;came from the visual&nbsp;observation in&nbsp;nature. Arnheim maintained that vision and perception are creative, active understanding, and that we organize perceptions into structures and form with which to understand them.&nbsp; Rudolf believes that a mind must process two functions. It must gather information and it must process it[RudolfArnheim]. In theory, we can separate these two functions neatly. But in practice, they always work together at the same time. He conclude that the perceiving and thinking in cognition is indivisable. The &quot;Boring figure&quot;, presented by the psychologists E. G. Boring (1886-1968),&nbsp; that is considered as yound lady can also be perceived as a old woman. The same facts used to convince the evolutionary theory can also be used for creationism. Darwin&#39;s theory is the biggest psudeoscience of his times. It is a biggest&nbsp;LOL of this time.</div>

<div p="1">(3) Critics of the evolution theory were&nbsp;numerious but&nbsp;unable to thoroughly turn it <span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>over,&nbsp;because&nbsp;no other better theories&nbsp;could be found to replace it. Darwin challenged that&nbsp;&quot;Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare?&quot;<sup>[]</sup>&nbsp; However, if Darwin could&nbsp;know that&nbsp;OOM is a simple and precise&nbsp;natural principle about the origin of species, it&nbsp;would not spend his whole life to defense his problematic theory.&nbsp;Fully understanding of OOM can not only answer all the questions about the origin of species, why and how the variations occurs,&nbsp;&nbsp;but also can perceive the glory of the Creator under His progressive revelation.&nbsp;Instead of leading people to a cul-de-sac in&nbsp;Darwin&#39;s&nbsp;unknown theory, OOM can provide&nbsp;a right direction to be able to see the bright future. At least, the popular&nbsp;and practical OOM not only can accurately point out in details how and where its errors occurs in his species-mutable&nbsp;theory, but also can fill out his unknown theory to be a best candidate among&nbsp;options&nbsp;to&nbsp;fully replace his biological natrual selection principles and fully solve the issues of origin of species. In any case, OOM can help theologians or missionaries to stop dodging&nbsp;or endlessly arguing with the Darwin&#39;s theory, and&nbsp;OOM theory can end the war of Darwin by effectively&nbsp;proving&nbsp;that Darwin&#39;s evolution theory is one of the&nbsp;biggest pseudoscience in history.<!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%20%2D%2D%3E--><!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D-%25%20If%20polymorphism%20and%20heredity%20are%20considered%20as%20to%20enrich%20and%20smooth%20out%20the%20variation%20of%20the%20world%2C%20then%20encapsulation%20provide%20the%20limitation%20and%20boundaries%20of%20variation.%20Cat%20and%20tiger%20are%20different%20classes%20no%20matter%20how%20similar%20they%20are.%20Likewise%2C%20man%20and%20ape.%20%20%0A%25In%20programming%20languages%2C%20encapsulation%20is%20used%20to%20refer%20to%20one%20of%20two%20related%20but%20distinct%20notions%2C%20and%20sometimes%20to%20the%20combination%5B1%5D%5B2%5D%20thereof%3A%0A%0A%25A%20language%20mechanism%20for%20restricting%20direct%20access%20to%20some%20of%20the%20object's%20components.%5B3%5D%5B4%5D%0A%25A%20language%20construct%20that%20facilitates%20the%20bundling%20of%20data%20with%20the%20methods%20(or%20other%20functions)%20operating%20on%20that%20data.%5B5%5D%5B6%5D%0A%0A%25%20Computer%20and%20human%20languages%20are%20similar%20in%20many%20ways.%20Both%20are%20script%20languages%20used%20to%20transfer%20information%20from%20one%20world%20to%20another.%20Both%20can%20be%20stored%20in%20physical%20medium%20as%20scripts%20permanently.%20But%20most%20essentially%20they%20both%20have%20to%20go%20through%20OO%20way%2C%20the%20process%20of%20object-class-object.%20This%20is%20particular%20evident%20when%20analysing%20OBI%2C%20which%20is%20not%20only%20the%20object%20oriented%2C%20but%20also%20the%20piture%20oriented%20abstracted%20scripture%20languages.%20%0A%0A%0A%25In%20OBI%2C%20there%20exists%20large%20amount%20of%20similarities%20and%20repeating%20among%20six%20thousands%20idential%20characters.%20For%20systemetic%20analysis%20on%20OBI%2C%20there%20is%20no%20better%20tool%20than%20OO%20method.%20%0A%2D%2D%2D%2D%3E--></div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">1. Creation Theology</a></div>

<div subpagesize="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">In Genesis, there are three different accounts about the creation of the world. (1) Gen1:3-1:31 (2) Gen2:1-25. (3) Gen5:1-32. These three accounts can be considered as the identical creation record but from different perspectives: from a whole worldview to a focused man view,&nbsp;and to a chronical human history view. Each account is getting closer and&nbsp;closer to each human being. Hence, the three accounts can also be called the three-layers creation theory.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Man is the center of the creation of all three layers. Genesis 1 shows that the creation of man has three steps: The first step is a saying process (Gen 1:26). &quot;And God said, Let us make <strong><em>man</em></strong> in our <strong>image</strong>, after our <strong>likeness...</strong>&quot; (וַיֹּאמֶר&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;נַֽעֲשֶׂה&nbsp;<strong>אָדָם</strong>&nbsp;בְּצַלְמֵנוּ&nbsp;כִּדְמוּתֵנ)(Gen 1:26) From the&nbsp;verse, it can be found that the created &#39;man&#39; has following properties: (1)&nbsp;&#39;man&#39; possesses abstract image of God. (2) &#39;man&#39; possesses the tangible likeness of God.&nbsp;But the scripture did&nbsp;not tell what &#39;likeness&#39; mean. It likely could mean&nbsp;that &#39;man&#39;&nbsp;can speak, see, walk&nbsp;etc. like God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The second step is a doing process(Gen 1:27). &quot;So God created <strong>man</strong> in his own <strong>image</strong>, in the <strong>image</strong> of God created he him; <strong>male</strong> and <strong>female</strong> created them.&quot;(וַיִּבְרָא&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;אֶת־הָֽ<strong>אָדָם</strong>&nbsp;בְּ<strong>צַלְמ</strong>וֹ&nbsp;בְּ<strong>צֶלֶם</strong>&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;בָּרָא&nbsp;אֹתוֹ&nbsp;<strong>זָכָר</strong>&nbsp;וּ<strong>נְקֵבָה</strong>&nbsp;בָּרָא&nbsp;אֹתָֽם׃) (Gen 1:27) From this verse, it can be found that &#39;man&#39; posseses an additional property: &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female.&#39;</div>

<div p="1">The third step is a blessing process (Gen1:28).&nbsp;&quot;God blessed them and said to them, &#39;Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.&#39;&quot; (Gen1:28 NIV) Here it can be seen that the blessing and saying are indivisible. The blessing is accomplished through saying.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">There is a obscure linkage between the&nbsp;three steps of the creation of man and the trinity of the Father, the Son and the Spirit. Such linkage is not can be seen in the three layers of creation of the world, but also in three steps of the creation of man.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first layer and in the first step, God and man are emphasized.&nbsp;In the second layer, the second step,&nbsp;man (as contrast to womam) is emphasized in detail. In the third layer, the third steps, human family tree&nbsp;is deployed.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<div p="">&#39;Man&#39; (<strong>אָדָם adam</strong>)</div>

<div p="">According to Genesis 1, man was created in two steps. The first step&nbsp;is a saying process.&nbsp;&quot;And God said, Let us make <strong><em>man</em></strong> in our <strong>image</strong>, after our <strong>likeness...</strong>&quot; (וַיֹּאמֶר&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;נַֽעֲשֶׂה&nbsp;<strong>אָדָם</strong>&nbsp;בְּצַלְמֵנוּ&nbsp;כִּדְמוּתֵנ)(Gen 1:26) From the&nbsp;verse, it can be found that the created &#39;man&#39; has following properties: (1)&nbsp;&#39;man&#39; possesses abstract image of God. (2) &#39;man&#39; possesses the tangible likeness of God.&nbsp;But the scripture did&nbsp;not tell what &#39;likeness&#39; mean. It likely could mean&nbsp;that &#39;man&#39;&nbsp;can speak, see, walk&nbsp;etc. like God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The second step is a doing process. &quot;So God created <strong>man</strong> in his own <strong>image</strong>, in the <strong>image</strong> of God created he him; <strong>male</strong> and <strong>female</strong> created them.&quot;(וַיִּבְרָא&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;אֶת־הָֽ<strong>אָדָם</strong>&nbsp;בְּ<strong>צַלְמ</strong>וֹ&nbsp;בְּ<strong>צֶלֶם</strong>&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;בָּרָא&nbsp;אֹתוֹ&nbsp;<strong>זָכָר</strong>&nbsp;וּ<strong>נְקֵבָה</strong>&nbsp;בָּרָא&nbsp;אֹתָֽם׃) (Gen 1:27) From this verse, it can be found that &#39;man&#39; posseses an additional property: &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">In Hebrew, &#39;man&#39; (אָדָם adam, 552x) comes from primitive root אָדַם meaning to be red, red. It has multiple different concepts and senses:&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">
<div>(1) abstract noun:&nbsp;&#39;human being&#39; (species) with image/likeness&nbsp;of God,&nbsp;Gen 1:26-27.</div>
</div>

<div p="">(2) collective gender nonspecific noun:&nbsp;&#39;mankind&#39; (race), including male and female, ie.&nbsp;Gen1:27, Gen5:1-2</div>

<div p="">(3) proper&nbsp;noun:&nbsp;Adam, the first man. Gen 2:7</div>

<div p="">(4) gender specific noun:&nbsp;husband, male individual, Gen2:23-24</div>

<div p="">
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">The Hebrew OT uses the word אָדָם&lrm; ( &#39;adam ) in all of its senses: collectively (&quot;mankind&quot;, Genesis 1:27), individually (a &quot;man&quot;, Genesis 2:7), gender nonspecific (&quot;man and woman&quot;, Genesis 5:1&ndash;2), and male (Genesis 2:23&ndash;24).[7]</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">In Genesis 1:27 &quot;adam&quot; is used in the collective sense, and the interplay between the individual &quot;Adam&quot; and the collective &quot;humankind&quot; is a main literary component to the events that occur in the Garden of Eden, the ambiguous meanings embedded throughout the moral, sexual, and spiritual terms of the narrative reflecting the complexity of &#39;man&#39;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The word &#39;image&#39; (צֶלֶם&nbsp; selem, 17x) comes from an unused root meaning to shade. [blueletter] (A) image of (tumours, mice, heathen gods (B) image, lineness (of resemblance) (C) mere, empty, image, sembance.&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp;&quot;Surely a man goes about as a <strong>shadow</strong>! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather!&quot; (Psm39:6 ESV)&nbsp;&quot;As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their <strong>image</strong>.&quot; (Psm73:20 KJV)</div>

<div p="">The word &#39;likeness&#39; (דְּמוּת demut, 22x) comes from the primitive root&nbsp;דָּמָה (dama) meaning &#39;to be like&#39;, &#39;resemble&#39;&nbsp; i.e. &quot;For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD(יְהֹוָה)? who among the sons of the mighty can be <strong>likened</strong> unto the LORD(יְהֹוָה)?&quot; (Psa 89:6 KJV)</div>

<div p="">The difference between the &#39;image&#39; and &#39;likeness&#39; is that &#39;image&#39; refers to intangeble or invisible internal or essential thing. Whereas &#39;likeness&#39; refers to the outer tangeable thing. This difference can be verified in Gen2:7, where the breath and spirit correspond&nbsp;to image, the likeness&nbsp;corresponds&nbsp;to the form of dust of the ground.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">
<div p="">It seems that&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a discrepency between the&nbsp;two steps -- what God said differed to what God created. In the first step, God wanted &#39;man&#39; to resemble to&nbsp;&#39;God&#39; both internally and externally. But in the second step, &#39;man&#39;&nbsp;was created not to assemle to &#39;God&#39; with the&nbsp;property of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; -- The whole Bible shows that God does not have property of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female.&#39; How &#39;man&#39; differs to God is primarily determined by &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female.&#39; In another word, &#39;male&#39; or &#39;female&#39; is&nbsp;a factor&nbsp;that &#39;man&#39; dissemble to God.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div p="">The discrepancy between the two step&nbsp;processes during the creation of man may reveal&nbsp;a&nbsp;message&nbsp;about&nbsp;man -- the creation of man was done but not yet. Among all things created in the six days,&nbsp;not all of them were&nbsp;seen&nbsp;&#39;good&#39; in eyes of God. For example, God did not say the expanse &#39;sky&#39; was good in the second day.&nbsp;Particularly, in the sixth day, God said twice &#39;it was good.&#39; The first time is after the living creatures including livestock and&nbsp;wild animals were&nbsp;created. The second time is at the end of the sixth day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Man was created right after the living creatures, but was not immediately being said by God &#39;it was good&#39; the same as the living creatures were. Although God added an adjective word&nbsp;&#39;very&#39; (מְאֹד mod) to express how better it was than others at the end of the sixth day, the phrase &#39;very good&#39;&nbsp;was not particully&nbsp;pointed to&nbsp;man. It hints that created man is &#39;not good&#39;, which can be confirmed&nbsp;later &quot;it is <strong>not good</strong> for the man to be alone&quot; (Gen2:18). The hindsight&nbsp;shows that man would not become&nbsp;good&nbsp;until some&nbsp;day after when God said &#39;this is my beloved son.&#39; &nbsp;This could be a reason that the OT need the NT to come to the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">
<div p="">On the other hand, what God said cannot contradict to what He did. In another word, the step one and step two have&nbsp;to be consistent. By comparison&nbsp;between the two steps, it can be found that a&nbsp;crititical difference&nbsp;lie in elemets of &#39;likeness&#39; and&nbsp;&#39;male and female.&#39;&nbsp; The first step has the &#39;likeness&#39; but no &#39;male and female;&#39; the second step has &#39;male and female&#39; but no &#39;likeness.&#39;&nbsp;In the second step, if the property of&nbsp;&#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; can be considered as a replacement with &#39;likeness,&#39; then, the property of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; would be&nbsp;an expanse or a further articulation of &#39;likeness.&#39; With a mathmatic resolution method, the two steps can be expressed with&nbsp;two equations, (1) man = image +&nbsp;likeness, (2) man = image + (male or female). The two linear system equations can be solved as: likeness&nbsp;= male or female. The account of Gen 5:1-2 can further confirm that likeness is related to &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female.&#39;</div>

<div p="">5:1&nbsp; בְּרֹא&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;אָדָם&nbsp;בִּדְמוּת&nbsp;אֱלֹהִים&nbsp;עָשָׂה&nbsp;אֹתֽוֹ׃<br />
(5:2)&nbsp;זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בְּרָאָם&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&#39;Likeness&#39; can including many characters, including the action (speaking, seeing or walking etc.),&nbsp;the emotion (like feelings), the intelligence (like thinking, reasoning etc), or gender (male or female).&nbsp;&nbsp;But Genesis 1 particularly focus on the likeness in male and female. It indicates that &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are more important than any other characters in the likeness.&nbsp;It also could raise a question: is that meant that God has character of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;? However, without further reading, the meanings of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are unknown for readers in Genesis 1. It could be a&nbsp;reason that leads to Genesis 2, narratating the creation&nbsp;of the world&nbsp;from a differrent perspective.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&#39;Woman&#39; (אִשָּׁה)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">However, it seems that&nbsp;Genesis 2 is not written&nbsp;to solve&nbsp;the questions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;pairs of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; of&nbsp;Genesis 1.&nbsp;Indeed, the words of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are not even mentioned&nbsp;in Genesis 2. Instead, it provides a new pairs of &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman.&#39; Although Genesis 2 could not help to answer the question about &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;, it&nbsp;provides an important clue for futher that can connect the pairs of &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; to&nbsp;the pairs of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female.&#39; In another word, to underatand the biblical meaning of the pairs of &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; is a key to better understand the pairs of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female.&#39;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">If Genesis 1 is considered to be about how generic abstract &#39;human being&#39; was created, then Genesis 2 is about how &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; as in pairs was created conreately.&nbsp;Through two individuals Adam and Eve, Genesis 2 clearly shows&nbsp;how human beings both man and woman are commonly connected to God: (1) Both Adam and Eve&nbsp;are&nbsp;directly created by God in his own hands. (2) Among all human beings,&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam and Eve are the only two special individuals created by God&#39;s hands rather born from parents.&nbsp;If any religious people want to worship someone, Adam and Eve are logically the best candidates. No one else can compare with Adam and Eve.&nbsp;(3) Both of them share&nbsp;identical quality&nbsp;of materials of flesh and bones (Gen2:23) -- that was created by God with dust of ground and breath of God. (4) According Gen 1, both Adam and Eve, no matter &#39;male&#39; or &#39;female&#39;, &#39;man&#39; or &#39;woman&#39;,&nbsp;have a common goal and mission: &#39;Be fruitfule and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it, Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground&#39;&nbsp;(Gen 1:28) &nbsp;</div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Genesis 2:7 is the first verse where &quot;Adam&quot; takes on the sense of an individual man (the first man), and the context of sex is absent; the gender distinction of &quot;adam&quot; is then reiterated in Genesis 5:1&ndash;2 by defining &quot;male and female&quot;.[7]</span></div>

<div p="">There&nbsp; are many differences between Adam and Eve. (1) The creation order in time and space is different: Adam was created&nbsp;first (2:7) outside Eden; Eve was created later inside Eden (2:22). Adam was&nbsp;the first born, the primary one; Eve is the second&nbsp;born, the second one. Adam stayed more time with God and he knew more of God than Eve --&nbsp;Adam is closer than Eve. (2) the creation&nbsp;method&nbsp;is&nbsp;differrent: Adam was created directly from dust of ground; Eve was created from the rib of Adam; Adam was a initiatial&nbsp;man; Eve was a cloned-man. In order to emphasize such different, the pairs of word &#39;woman&#39; (אִשָּׁה, isha) and &#39;man&#39; (אִישׁ ish) are used to distinguish between Eve and Adam (Gen2:22-23).&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The creation purpose is different: Adam was created to remember the word of God and to guard the Eden; Eve was created to help Adam. &quot;neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.&quot; (1Co11:9 NIV)</div>

<div p="">Within its&nbsp;context&nbsp;when Adam and Eve were&nbsp;created (Gen2:7, Gen2:22),&nbsp;the&nbsp;sex and&nbsp;gender are&nbsp;not mentioned. In another word, except the creation differences featured with the&nbsp;pairs of&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;man&#39; (אִישׁ ish) and &#39;woman&#39; (אִשָּׁה, isha), Adam and Eve are completely&nbsp;identical two individuals. They even shares the same name &#39;Adam&#39; given by God. Adam initially called Eve as &#39;woman&#39; (isha) to distinguish himself. But in eyes of God, Adam and Eve are like a twin and are hard to distinguish by name. The name of Eve was given by Adam&nbsp;(Gen3:20) right before they were driven out of Eden and after&nbsp;they were cursed&nbsp;due to the fall.&nbsp;The biological or sex difference&nbsp;between Adam and Eve did not show up until after the fall&nbsp;when Eve was cursed (Gen3:16). It is after the fall of Adam and Eve&nbsp;that the distinction between &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; is&nbsp;reiterrated in human historical&nbsp;account (Gen5:1-2). It is the sin that cause the&nbsp;gender distinction to become more and more prominent&nbsp;in human culture.&nbsp;It means that sex or gender is not the key factor that makes differrence between man and woman. The OT does not have&nbsp;the word &#39;sex&#39; and &#39;gender&#39; in Hebrew dictionary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">In Hebrew, ish has multiple sense: &#39;man&#39;, &#39;male&#39; (in contrast to woman, female), &#39;husband&#39;, &#39;human being&#39;, &#39;person&#39; (in contrast to God), &#39;servant&#39;, &#39;mankind&#39;, &#39;champion&#39;, &#39;great man&#39;, &#39;whosoever&#39;,<br />
&#39;each&#39; (adjective).</div>

<div p="">As a pair of ish(אִישׁ) ,(&nbsp;אִשָּׁה, isha (אִשָּׁה) means: &#39;woman&#39;, &#39;wife&#39;, &#39;female&#39;, &#39;woman&#39; (opposite of man), &#39;wife&#39; (woman married to a man), &#39;female&#39; (of animals), &#39;each&#39;, &#39;every&#39; (pronoun).&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Conclusion:</div>

<div p="">Two words are used in the OT to express &#39;man&#39;:&nbsp;Adam(אָדָם) and Ish (אִישׁ). They can interplay&nbsp;and have multiple sense:&nbsp;(1) human being as species (2) mankind for&nbsp;race (both man and woman),&nbsp; (3) gender specific for male man and husband. (4) an individual person (gender nonspecific)&nbsp;or a male person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The pairs of &#39;man&#39; (ish, or adam) and &#39;woman&#39; (isha) belongs to divine&nbsp;creational words used to distingusih the closeness in a degree&nbsp;and duties for each individual in&nbsp;the mission of God. The pairs of &#39;man&#39; (ish) and &#39;woman&#39; (isha) has no direct relationship with &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; or gender and&nbsp;sex.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Biblical Meaning of Gender</div>

<div p="1">The Hebrew word &#39;male&#39; (זָכָר&nbsp;&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen90">zakar</em>) and &#39;female&#39; (נְקֵבָה&nbsp;&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen95">neqebah</em>), which are used to describe the gender or sex for people today, first appear&nbsp;during the second step of the process of the creation of&nbsp;man (אָדָם <em id="yui-gen69">adam</em>) &nbsp;&quot;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male&nbsp;(זָכָר) and female&nbsp; (נְקֵבָה) created them.&quot; (Gen 1:27) Clearly, man not only is associated with the image of God, but also has characters of distinction between&nbsp;&#39;male&#39; and &#39;female.&#39; In another word, in the second step of the process in the creation of man, God created three things: man (אָדָם <em id="yui-gen69">adam</em>) , male&nbsp;(זָכָר) and female (נְקֵבָה).&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">In Hebrew, the word &#39;male&#39; (זָכָר) and &#39;female&#39; (נְקֵבָה) are completely different in meaning. The word male (זָכָר) comes from a primitive root (זָכַר) that means &quot;to remember, recall, call to mind.&quot;&nbsp;The word&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; (נְקֵבָה) is related to&nbsp;a primitive root (נָקַב) that means &quot;to pierce, perforate, bore, appoint; to curse, blaspheme.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">After the first appearance in creation of man in Gen1:27, &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; keep&nbsp;being used in&nbsp;pairs (Gen5:2;&nbsp;6:19; 7:3,9,16) until the time when God (elohim) made covenant with Abraham, &#39;every male shall be circumcised&#39; (Gen17:10),&nbsp;where it is the first time to show&nbsp;how&nbsp;&#39;male&#39; differs to&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; until the end of the Genesis with total of 9 times. In the context of Genesis,&nbsp;the solitary &#39;male&#39; is used for circumcise to reprsent the redeem covenant with God.&nbsp;In the OT, &#39;male&#39; occurs 81 times. The solitary &#39;male&#39; mostly is related to &#39;redeem&#39;, the first-born, father,&nbsp; in&nbsp;the same context with God. &nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The solitary appearance of&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; first occurs&nbsp;in the&nbsp;context related to the redemption using&nbsp;a female (נְקֵבָה)&nbsp;goat without blemish (Lev4:28) The word &#39;female&#39; occuurs 22 times in total in the OT. Most of time, it is related to cleanness (clean or unclean)&nbsp;(Lev 4:32,&nbsp;Lev12:5, Lev15:33). Only&nbsp;once, it is used positively,&nbsp;&quot;How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter (בַּת)? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman (נְקֵבָה) shall compass a man (גָּֽבֶר).&quot; (Jer 31:22)&nbsp; This is also the only place that &#39;female&#39; and &#39;daughter&#39; are solitarily in the same context.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">As noun, &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; can interplay with &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39;. Since male and femaled can be used as adjective for&nbsp;animals, its meaning were extended, at the same time, its meaning became more focused on sex&nbsp;and gender.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">From these, it can be seen that &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are religious words: &#39;male&#39; is associated with circumsization or in memory of covenant;&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; is associated with blemish and unclean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">In the OT, there is no such word &#39;sex&#39;&nbsp;or &#39;gender&#39;&nbsp;in Hebrew. The closest word in meaning&nbsp;is <em>raba</em> (רָבַע) in Hebrew, which means: &#39;to lie stretched out&#39;, &#39;lie down&#39;&nbsp;where it is tranlated as &#39;gender&#39; in KJV (Lev 18:23, 19:19, 20:16) The absence of &#39;sex&#39; and &#39;gender&#39; in the Hebrew context indicated that the male&nbsp;and female are not determined by sex or gender.&nbsp;The OT&nbsp;never specifies&nbsp;any one is male or female. In another word, &nbsp;&#39;son&#39; is &#39;male&#39; not because of the mascline in gender or sex. The connection between &#39;male&#39; and &#39;son&#39; in Gen17:23 is purely based on the consistency in their&nbsp;biblical meaning.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">In the OT, &#39;male&#39; occurs 81 times, &#39;female&#39; 22 times;&nbsp;This is not about the gender discrimination but about the covenant of God, the salvation and redemption.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&quot;so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol (פֶּסֶל), an image (תַּבְנִית)of any shape, whether formed like (תַּבְנִית) a man (זָכָר) or a woman (נְקֵבָה),&quot; (Deu4:16 NIV)</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Conclusion</div>

<div p="1">In the OT, &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are religious words: &#39;male&#39; is associated with circumsization or in memory of covenant;&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; is associated with blemish and unclean.&nbsp;In the OT, there is no such word &#39;sex&#39;&nbsp;or &#39;gender&#39;&nbsp;in Hebrew. The bibical concept of son and daughter is&nbsp;gender non-specific. There are direct connection between &#39;male&#39; and &#39;son&#39; in context, whereas&nbsp;it is not based on the gender but&nbsp;purely based on the consistency in their&nbsp;biblical meaning for the same purpose of the mission of God -- to keep remembering the covenant with God for He will accomplish his great plan.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">In the OT, the word &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; first appear in Genesis 2 right after Adam and Eve met each other after they were created respectively by God.&nbsp;&quot;For this reason (&nbsp;עַל־כֵּן) a man&nbsp;אִישׁ will leave his father (אָב) and mother (אֵם)and be united to his wife (אִשָּׁה), and they will become one flesh.&quot; (Gen2:24 NIV)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">There are two parts in this verse. The first part is about the parents. The second part is about the marriage. This verse has been directly quoted and discussed in the NT (Mat19:4-5, Mak10:6-9, Eph5:31-32, 1Co6:16-17). Even Jesus quoted this verse (Mat19:5,&nbsp; Mak10:6-9). However, all of discussion focus on the issue of &#39;marriage&#39;, the later part of the verse. The first part about the parents was rarely questioned and hence seldomly discussed directly&nbsp;in the NT (Mat8:21-22)&nbsp;&quot;Another disciple said to him, &quot;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&quot;&quot; (Mat8:21 NIV)&nbsp;&quot;But Jesus told him, &quot;Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&quot;&quot; (Mat8:22 NIV).&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He replied to him, &quot;Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?&quot;&quot; (Mat12:48 NIV)&nbsp;&quot;For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.&quot;&quot; (Mat12:50 NIV)</div>

<div p="">Two issues for the first part of the verse: (1) who said so? (2) what&nbsp;are&nbsp;the &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; meant to?</div>

<div p="">(1) Who said the words&nbsp;Gen2:24?</div>

<div p="">Because previous verse of Gen2:24 is a quotation from&nbsp;Adam (Gen2:23), also because ancient Hebrew scripture has not quot mark, so there are two possibilities for Gen2:24: (a) it&nbsp;is part of the quotation&nbsp;from&nbsp;Adam. (b) it is not part of quotation but&nbsp;from narrator (Moses).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Among total of thirty English Bible translations with&nbsp;quot mark published after 1900, all versions adopt&nbsp;(b). Literal Standard Version (https://biblehub.com/lsv/genesis/2.htm) only quots the first part of Gen2:23.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The reasons for&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(1) Adam had no parents. He knew nothing about parents. He could not say anything about parents. (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary)</div>

<div p="">(2) Jesus quotes these as spoken by God (Mat19:5) (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary, Benson Commentary)</div>

<div p="">(4) prediction by Moses(Gill&#39;s Exposition of the Entire Bible);&nbsp;<strong>the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God&nbsp;</strong>(Ellicott&#39;s Commentary)</div>

<div p="">(5) &#39;<strong>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; introduces his inference</strong>&#39; :&nbsp;Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Reason for (a)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(1) Adam understood God&#39;s meaning about&nbsp;Eve. (Barnes&#39; Notes)</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Uncertain:</div>

<div p="">Barnes&#39; Notes,&nbsp;Matthew Poole&#39;s Commentary&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">If from Moses, the parents are culture.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">if from Adam, the parents would refer to God, his creator. But never say Himself as &#39;father&#39;, moreover, never &#39;mother&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Ellicott&#39;s Commentary for English Readers (https://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/2-24.htm): &quot;These are evidently the words of the narrator. Adam names this new product of creative power, as he had named others, but <strong>he knew nothing about young men leaving their father&rsquo;s house for the wife&rsquo;s sake.</strong> Moreover, in <strong>Matthew 19:5, our Lord quotes these words as spoken by God</strong>, and the simplest interpretation of this declaration is that <strong>the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God </strong>to give this solemn sanction to marriage, founded upon Adam&rsquo;s words. The great and primary object of this part of the narrative is to set forth marriage as a Divine ordinance. The narrator describes Adam&rsquo;s want, pictures him as examining all animal life, and studying the habits of all creatures so carefully as to be able to give them names, but as returning from his search unsatisfied. At last one is solemnly brought to him who is his counterpart, and he calls her Ishah, his feminine self, and pronounces her to be his very bone and flesh. Upon this, &ldquo;He who at the beginning made them male and female &ldquo;pronounced the Divine marriage law that man and wife are one flesh.&quot;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Benson Commentary: &quot;It appears by Matthew 19:4-5, that it was God himself who said here, a man must leave all his relations to cleave to his wife;</div>

<div p="">but whether he spake this by Moses or by Adam, is uncertain.&quot;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div>Barnes&#39; Notes on the Bible:</div>

<div>These might be the words of the first man Genesis 2:24. As he thoroughly understood the relation between himself and the woman, there is no new difficulty in conceiving him to become acquainted at the same time with the relationship of son to father and mother, which was in fact only another form of that in which the newly-formed woman stood to himself. The latter is really more intimateand permanent than the former, and naturally therefore takes its place, especially as the practical of the filial tie, - that of being trained to maturity, - is already accomplished, when the conjugal one begins.</div>

<div>But it seems more probable that this sentence is the reflection of the inspired author on the special mode in which the female was formed from the male. Such remarks of the writer are frequently introduced by the word &quot;therefore&quot; (על־כן kēn-‛al). It is designed to inculcate on the race that was to spring from them the inviolable sanctity of the conjugal relation.</div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">In the primeval wedlock one man was joined to one woman only for life. Hence, in the marriage relation the animal is subordinate to the rational. The communication of ideas; the cherishing of the true, the right, the good; the cultivation of the social affections; the spontaneous outflow of mutual good offices; the thousand nameless little thoughts, looks, words, and deeds that cheer the brow and warm the heart; the common care of children, servants, and dependents; the constant and heartfelt worship of the Father of all, constitute the main ends and joys of the married state.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">After the exclamation of the man on contemplating the woman, as bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, and therefore physically, intellectually, and morally qualified to be his mate, we may suppose immediately to follow the blessing of man, and the general endowment of himself and the animals with the fruits of the soil as recorded in the preceding chapter Genesis 1:28-30. The endowment of man embraces every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. This general grant was of course understood by man to exclude the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was excepted, if not by its specific nature, yet by the previous command given to man. This command we find was given before the formation of the woman, and therefore sometime before the events recorded in the second and third clauses of Genesis 1:27. Hence, it preceded the blessing and the endowment. It was not special, however, to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to be intended for other purposes than the food of man, as there are very many other trees that afford no proper nutriment to man. The endowment, therefore, refers to such trees as were at the same time nutritive and not expressly and previously forbidden.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">This chapter is occupied with the &quot;generations, issues or products of the skies and the land,&quot; or, in other words, of the things created in the six days. It is the meet preface to the more specific history of man, as it records his constitution, his provision, his moral and intellectual cultivation, and his social perfection. It brings us up to the close of the sixth day. As the Creator pronounced a sentence of approbation on all that he had made at the end of that day, we have reason to believe that no moral derangement had yet taken place in man&#39;s nature.</span></div>

Therefore shall a man leave his father, and his mother,.... These are thought by some to be the words of Moses, inferring from the above fact, what ought to be among men; and by others, the words of Adam under divine inspiration, <strong>as the father of mankind instructing his sons what to do, and foretelling what would be done in all succeeding ages: though they rather seem to be the words of God himself, by whom marriage was now instituted;</strong></div>

24. Therefore shall a man, &amp;c.] This verse contains the comment which the narrator makes upon the words of the man in Genesis 2:23. <strong>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; introduces his inference. </strong>As in Genesis 10:9, Genesis 26:33, Genesis 32:32, a sentence beginning with &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; supplies the application, or relation, of the ancient narrative to later times. It is the man who is to leave &ldquo;father and mother,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the woman.&rdquo; Some compare the story in Jdg 15:1, where the woman remains with her family or clan, and Samson comes to live with her. This feature has been thought to illustrate the primitive usage of &ldquo;the matriarchate.&rdquo; But it is unlikely that the Hebrew narrative would contain a reference to such conditions.</div>

<div>Instead of &ldquo;shall leave,&rdquo; the full force of the tense in the Hebrew would be given by &ldquo;doth leave&rdquo; and &ldquo;cleaveth.&rdquo; The sanctity of marital relations is thus referred back to the very birthday of human society, being based on a principle laid down before the Fall.</div>

<div>The relation of the man to his wife is proclaimed to be closer than that to his father and mother. By the words, &ldquo;shall cleave unto his wife &hellip; one flesh,&rdquo; is asserted the sanctity of marriage. Polygamy is not definitely excluded; but the principle of monogamy seems to be implied in the words &ldquo;cleave&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall be one flesh&rdquo;: and this principle is upheld by the prophets as the ideal of marriage, in their representation of the relation of Jehovah and Israel under the metaphor of the married state.</div>

<div>Pulpit Commentary<br />
Verse 24. - Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife. There is nothing in the use of such terms as father and mother, or in the fact that the sentiment is prophetic, to prevent the words from being regarded as a continuation of Adam&#39;s speech, although, on the other hand, the statement of Christ (Matthew 19:5) <strong>does not preclude the possibility of Moses being their author; but whether uttered by the first husband (Delitzsch, Macdonald) or by the historian (Calvin, Murphy), they must be viewed as an inspired declaration of the law of marriage. Its basis (fundamental reason and predisposing cause) they affirm to be</strong></div>

<div>(1) the original relationship of man and woman, on the platform of creation; and</div>

<div>(2) the marriage union effected between the first pair. Its nature they explain to be</div>

<div>(1) a forsaking (on the part of the woman as well as the man) of father and mother - not filially, in respect of duty, but locally, in respect of habitation, and comparatively, in respect of affection; and</div>

<div p="">The image of God has no gender. Regarding the duties assigned to man, gender or sex is not necessary at all.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">God is faithful God. (Duet 7:9) &quot;I will not alter the word that went forth from my lips&quot; (Psa 89:34) &quot;As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.&quot;(Isaiah 55:10-11)</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Based on what God said after He created man, it can be seen that the primary purpose to create male and female is to &quot;Be fruitfule and increase in number; fill the earth&quot; (Gen 1:28) Today human beings think that being fruitful and increasing in number is related to gender and sex. However, in the eyes of God, man are genderless or sex-free. God never said that Adam(אָדָם) is male and Eve (חַוָּה) is female. God called Eve as woman (אִשָּׁה). The word woman (אִשָּׁה) comes from the primitive root word man (אִישׁ), which means &quot;part of man.&quot; Eve is originally called woman. The name of Eve was given by Adam after the fall of man. The word man and woman, the male and female are two pairs of words. But man and male, woman and female are not connected in Hebrew until the circumcision appears (Gen 17:10)</div>

<div p="">The absence of sex in the Hebrew context indicated that the male and female are not determined by sex or gender. The purpose to create male and female is not to create two kinds of human beings based on the gender or sex. In the eyes of God, males and females are one humankind. The distinction between the male and female is the seal of God set on humankind to prepare for human beings to be able to distinguish between son and daughter, the savior and saviee.</div>

<div p="">From this perspective, it can be seen that, what God said to man (Gen 1:28) is exactly the same as what Jesus said to His disciples.(Mat 28:19-20) (a) &quot;God bless them (man)&quot; refers to &quot;Surely I(Jesus) will be with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot; (b) &quot;be fruitful&quot; means &quot;make disciples&quot;, (c) &quot;increase in number and fill the earth&quot; means &quot;throughout all nations and baptizing (fill) them in name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot;, (d) &quot;subdue and rule over&quot; means &quot;teach them to obey everything I (Jesus) have commanded you.&quot; Jesus&#39; Great Commission is not something new but the command of God when man was created in the beginning. The distinction between male and female is the distinction between son and daughter, the Son and man, the disciples and the Gentiles. In the eyes of God, human beings have only two kinds: Christian and non-Christian, like sheep and goat (Mat 25:32)</div>

<div p="1">In a word, male and female are not the trouble makers leading to adultery or pain; instead, God created male and female to prepare for the Son of God to fulfill the salvation plan.</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">1. The Original&nbsp;Meaning of &#39;Son&#39; and &#39;Daughter&#39;</a>&nbsp;</div>

<div subpagesize="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&#39;Son&#39;</div>

<div p="1">The word &#39;son&#39;&nbsp;(בֵּן, <em>Ben</em>) first was used in a form of plural noun by HYWY with&nbsp;angry&nbsp;in a particular context after the fall of man and when earth&nbsp;(אֲדָמָה) would be cursed. HYWY said to Eve that &quot;with pain you will give birth to <b>children</b> (בָנִים&nbsp;&nbsp;sons)&quot; (בְּעֶצֶב&nbsp;תֵּֽלְדִי&nbsp;בָנִים Gen3:16) It can be found that, while&nbsp;&#39;son&#39; refers to descendant or offspring through verb &#39;give-birth&#39; (יָלַד&nbsp; yalad),&nbsp;&#39;son&#39;&nbsp;is closely associated with &#39;pain&#39; (עֵצֶב eseb) due to &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;curse&#39; and&nbsp;&#39;punishment&#39; in the immediate context.&nbsp; The plural form of &#39;son&#39; could&nbsp;mean&nbsp;(a) &#39;multiple sons&#39; horizontally or (b) &#39;son of son in multiple generations&#39; vertically. Compared with&nbsp;&#39;children&#39; (יְלָדִים yaladim) including boys and girls&nbsp;in Hebrew,&nbsp;only &#39;son of son in multiple generations&#39; could accurately refer to advent&nbsp;Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Further, the word &#39;son&#39; began to be used in singular form to represent an individual only after the first crime occurred. The first singular &#39;son&#39; is not used to describe&nbsp;Cain and&nbsp;Abel before the first crimal in history. In another word, Cain and Abel are not labed as first two &#39;sons&#39; of Adam and Eve in Gen4:1-2. First, the singular &#39;son&#39; was initiated to describe&nbsp;Enoch (Gen4:17), the child of Cain after Cain murdered his younger brother Abel.&nbsp;Then, it is used for Seth(Gen 4:25). Enoch is the son of the criminal&nbsp;Cain(Gen 4:17). Seth is the son &#39;in replace of&#39; the killed person Abel(Gen 4:25). In these context, it can be found that&nbsp;&quot;son&quot; is associated with the meaning of &#39;renew&nbsp;of life&#39; -- Enoch is the new life of murderer Cain, and Seth is the new life of the merdered brother&nbsp;Abel.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Cain is the first criminal in human history; he is also the first person to utilize the name of his son to protect himself with peace. &quot;Cain was building a city, and he names the city after his son (בֵּן) Enoch&quot; (Gen 4:17) It seems to Cain that the physical castle is not enough, he also has to attach the name of his son onto it in order to effectively protect him from punishment and to&nbsp;gain safety and peace. It is not unreasonable for Cain to do so. His baby son is little and not strong, but he&nbsp;is lovely and innocent. What&nbsp;Cain did is like what people see for today with&nbsp;the label on the car: &quot;Baby On Board.&quot; It can be seen that the Hebrew word &#39;son&#39;&nbsp;(<em>Ben)</em>&nbsp;initially has a functionality of the expectations that criminal parents could be exempt from the punishment in his life and the afterlife.</div>

<div p="1">Cain probably did not know the true reason behind the power of son. There is another person also called Enoch, the son of Jared, the offspring of Seth, the seventh grandson of Adam. &quot;Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.&quot;(Gen 5:18) Being different from Enoch the son of Cain who has nothing special, Enoch the son of Jared is famous and unique. Enoch (חֲנוֹךְ <em>hanok</em>) means &#39;dedicated.&#39; Enoch the dedicated son of Jared can bring hope for anyone who has a son. The story of Enoch the son of Jared is the beginning of the connection between son and the auspicious sign that is earlier than the son-preference in many cultures.</div>

<div p="1">The story of cognominal Enoch implies that &#39;son&#39;&nbsp;contains the meaning of not only the expectation of being exempt from punishment on earth, but also the hope of being saved by YHWY&nbsp;(יְהֹוָה , Gen2:4). After Seth had a son, men began to call on the name of the YHWY (יְהֹוָה, Gen 4:26). It can be seen in the context from Gen2-6 before the Flooding&nbsp;that the concept of &#39;son&#39;&nbsp;and the concept of the &#39;YHWY&#39; appears in a same context after Gen1. Both are important with different characters: one is majesty, dignity,&nbsp;prestige and&nbsp;awe, another&nbsp;is weak and gentle with silence. In the NT, Jesus&nbsp;frequently used &#39;God&#39; (אֱלֹהִים Elohim, the first noun&nbsp;in Gen1:1) to refer to&nbsp;&#39;Father&#39;, but He&nbsp;rarely use word&nbsp;&#39;YHWY&#39; in Gospels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Another&nbsp;difference between &#39;son&#39; and the &#39;Lord&#39; is that the name of the Lord is forbidden to misuse&nbsp;(Deut 5:11). Whereas, the word &#39;son&#39; is free to use in any&nbsp;culture and have no any&nbsp;restriction. This could be a&nbsp;reason that biblical meaning of &#39;son&#39; was easily ignored and lost in its culture. On the other hand, the wide use of &#39;son&#39; help to accomplish an important mission&nbsp;in the OT time -- to predict the advent of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div p="1">For example, when Abraham is tested (Gen 22), his only son Isaac becomes a prefigure to imply the sacrifice of Jesus. The story of the winding path of the life of Joseph (Gen 37-50), the son of Israel,&nbsp;is a foreshadow of the victory of the salvation of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div p="1">A more prominent prediction can be seen in the oracle of Isaiah. <span>&quot;For to us a child is born, to us a son (בֵּן) is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&quot; (Isa 9:6 ESV)</span></div>

<div p="1">Because of the biblical meaning and special mission, &#39;son&#39; became the most frequently used noun in the Hebrew OT.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book of 1Chronicle, &#39;son&#39; (<em>Ben)</em>&nbsp;repeated for 163 times. Its frequent rate is higher than the word &#39;God&#39;, &#39;YHWY&#39; and &#39;Lord&#39; (אדוני adonai). It is through the repetition of the word &#39;son&#39; that keeps reminding readers to watch out what the Scripture implied.&nbsp;<span>Ultimately, the word &#39;son&#39; becomes an alternative term for Messiah in the Gospels.</span></div>

<div p="1">In Hebrew, the primitive root of the word <em>Ben</em> (son) has a meaning to build, rebuild, establish, cause to continue. The primitive root of Buth (daughter) comes from <em>Ben</em>. Just like the relationship between Adam and Eve, and like male and female God created, son and daughter carries the meaning of the recreation of God after death.</div>

<div p="1">The biblical context demonstrates that, in the eyes of God, the word &#39;son&#39; (<em>Ben</em>) <span>has nothing to do with gender or sex, instead, the concept of son is associated with sin, curse, punishment, pain, hope, and renew of life and so on, all of those are the concept without gender or sex.</span>&nbsp;This could a reason that the word &#39;son&#39; (ben) sometimes&nbsp;is&nbsp;translated as &#39;child&#39; in other languages.</div>

<div p="1">
<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&#39;Daughter&#39;</div>

<div p="1">Compared with &#39;son in the OT, the usage of &#39;daughter&#39; is quite different. First, the usage frequent rate is much smaller than &#39;son&#39; in the OT (&#39;son&#39;: x6906, &#39;daughter&#39;: x588)</div>

<div p="1">Second, &#39;daughter&#39; appears later than &#39;son.&#39; Before the word &#39;daughter&#39; (בַּת bat)&nbsp;first appears in Gen 5:4,&nbsp;the word &#39;son&#39; has been used for four times(Gen3:16, 4:17, 4:25-26).</div>

<div p="1">Third, the first 19 &#39;daughter&#39; continously occur in a pairs with &#39;son&#39;&nbsp;until (Gen11:23). The total occurance in a pairs with &#39;son&#39; is nearly 50 in the OT.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;As far as the character of gender, the usage of &#39;daughter&#39; is similar to &#39;son&#39; -- both have obscure connection with &#39;male&#39; or &#39;female.&#39; In the initial context, the word &#39;son&#39; and &#39;daughter&#39; originally has nothing to do with gender or sex.&nbsp;Neither &#39;son&#39; nor &#39;daughter&#39; is specified with the gender &#39;male&#39; or &#39;female.&#39;&nbsp;In other words, &#39;son&#39; is not associated to &#39;male&#39;; &#39;daughter&#39; is not associated to &#39;female.&#39;&nbsp;The bibical concept of son and daughter is&nbsp;gender non-specific.</div>

<div p="1">Readers cannot identify if &#39;son&#39; belong to &#39;male&#39; or&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; in the immediate context without further reading until Gen 17:23. Before readers can distinct between &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; (Gen17:10), the word &#39;son&#39;&nbsp;(בֵּן, <em>Ben</em>) has been used for about fifty times. The word &#39;son&#39; and &#39;male&#39; are first time associated when Abraham first time began&nbsp;to execise the circumsication&nbsp;(Gen17:23). However, &#39;daughter&#39; and &#39;female&#39; cannot be found in a&nbsp;same context in the OT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div p="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Conclusion</span></div>

<div p="1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">From above anaylsis, it can be found that the original meaning of &#39;son&#39; is far beyond the literal meaning of &#39;offspreng&#39;. It is closely associated to &#39;pain&#39; due to &#39;sin&#39;, &#39;punishment&#39; and&nbsp;&#39;curse&#39;;&nbsp;it is also indirectly related to &#39;peace&#39;, &#39;protection&#39;, &#39;life renew&#39;. Moreover, with being less noticable and&nbsp;silent in the context, &#39;son&#39; represent a charateristics of weakness, meek&nbsp;and&nbsp;humble that can contrast the Lord&#39;s majesty, dignity and awe.&nbsp;Such kind of connection found in &#39;son&#39; cannot be found in different words with the same type or the same level of category, like&nbsp;&#39;daughter&#39;, &#39;child&#39;. From the early context, &#39;son&#39; is not associated with &#39;male&#39; or &#39;femal.&#39; The gender of &#39;son&#39; cannot be directly identified. From a soteriological perspective, &#39;son&#39;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">&nbsp;directly or indirectly refers to the Messiah throughout the OT --&nbsp;a prophecy term for the advent of Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">2.&nbsp;</a>In the NT</div>

<div p="1">In the NT, the worldly word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Huios</em>) is specially used to express a unique relationship between Jesus Christ and God: Jesus is the only Son of God, and God the Heavenly Father of Jesus Christ. The sonship relationship between the holy Son and the holy Father is to demonstrate that Jesus fully inherited all natures of God including the almighty power, the Kingdom and the glory. From a perspective of the Word (Logos), Jesus was with God in the beginning. Jesus was God. (John 1:1)</div>

<div p="1">Meanwhile, the worldly word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Huios</em>) is also used to express the relationship between Jesus and man. Jesus called Himself the son of Man. However, Jesus did not mean that man is His parents or father. Jesus is the son of man because the Father (God) has set his seal on Him. (John 6:27) In other words, Jesus is not the real son nor stepson but the adopted son of man. Jesus has no any genetic relationship with man. He did not inherit anything sinful from man. However, it is totally legal for anyone to adopt Jesus as his own son for his heritage, expectation and hope in the afterlife. Indeed, Jesus is the only son given to man for adoption. &quot;Those who have the Son has the eternal life&quot; (1John 5:12) Human salvation is accomplished through the sonship adoption process rather than the labors or good deeds.</div>

<div p="1">On the other hand, Jesus was not &quot;willing&quot; to be the son of man. It was the heavenly Father who force Him to be the son of man. He was born in a poor family of Mary and Joseph. He never felt proud to be the son of man nor his Jewish culture nor his family on earth. Jesus never called nor admitted anyone in the world as His mother or father. (Mat 12:48) But Jesus endured accomplishing all the duty what a son should do. Moreover, Jesus was forced to inherit all flesh weakness of man. He had to endure all shames, guilties, failures, bitterness and death of man. Jesus was heavily oppressed both by God and man. From this perspective, to be the son of man means to be like a poor little child being maltreated physically and spiritually by his parents.</div>

<div p="1">In a word, the &quot;son&quot; in the Gospel not only means a male offspring of his parents, and the role of expectation and hope of his parents for afterlife, but also implies an inheritance relationship between the only Savior and the God, the only Savior and the saviee, as well as the role of the God&#39;s salvation plan. Through the word of &quot;son&quot; and the multiple sonships of Jesus Christ, the common worldly sense of &quot;son&quot; has been contextualized to refer to the savior who is Jesus Christ&mdash;the Only Son of God. &quot;Whoever has the Son has life;&quot; (1John 5:12) Obviously, in the NT, the word son has a soteriological meaning that refers to Jesus Christ.</div>
</div>

<h3>III. Common Questions about &#39;Son&#39;</h3>

<section>
<div p="1">The common definition of &quot;son&quot; provides a strong rapport between the Messiah and Jesus Christ. The equalization between the Messiah and Jesus Christ is accomplished through the incarnation of the Word. Jesus said, &quot;Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.&quot; (Luke 4:20) In the NT, the soteriological meaning for son (<em>Huios</em>) is Jesus Christ; in the OT, <em>Ben</em> (son) always implies the advent of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(1) Why is it the son rather than daughter that is used to refer to Jesus Christ?</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The purpose to create male and female is not to create two kinds of human beings based on the gender or sex. In the eyes of God, males and females are one humankind but assigned with different characters to accomplish a common goal &#39;mulitply over the land&#39; (Gen1:29). Moreover, the distinction between the male and female is the seal of God set on humankind to prepare for human beings to be able to distinguish between son and daughter, the savior and saviee.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div note="There is no any city is named after the name of daughter." p="1">Since son already has the meaning of offspring of the sin (Gen 3:16). As an additional word to express the meaning of descendant, the information of the offspring of the killed person naturally falls on the word of daughter and becomes a key nature to distinct itself from son. Also, since the concept of son contains the meaning of hope and has roles of prediction of Jesus Christ in the OT. Thereafter, if son is considered relating to the protector and savior, then daughter would be related to the protectee and saviee. Initially, the distinction between the pair of son and daughter is not based on gender or sex, but based on the soteriological roles in the concept of salvation of God.</div>

<div note="There is no any city is named after the name of daughter." p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">As far as the duty of filial piety for parents and the mission of God, son and daughter have no difference. But regarding the role and functionality, they differ significantly. Only the son has the legal right to succeed the house-head position of his father. To accomplish the legal duty, when son grows up, he has to become a bridegroom to bring the bride into the family to fulfill the mission of marriage. &quot;the bride belongs to the bridegroom.&quot; (John 3:29) While He was a son of man on earth, Jesus wanted to be a bridegroom. Jesus answered, &ldquo;How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.&quot; (Mark 2:19-20) From a missiological viewpoint, son represent the missionary and daughter represents the lost one.</div>

<div p="">According to the Parable of the Great Wedding Feast (Mat 22:1-14, Luke 14:15&ndash;24), the Son of God is the bridegroom, the union of saviees is His bride. In the eyes of Jesus, the most beautiful bride is not based on the gender but based on the heart of the love of Him. The salvation is accomplished through the marriage between the Son of God and the children of God. This could explain why polygamy was illegal but permitted in the royal family in the OT time. It is not only &quot;because of the hardness of your heart&quot; (Mat 19:8), but also because of that, indirectly, it could be a shadow of the advent of salvation in the Heaven. Indeed, in the heaven, people will not be bothered by sexual desires, &quot;At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they be like the angels in heaven&quot; (Mat 22:30) On the earth, the role of sex is designated to maintain the existing of the race on earth due to the death of individuals. The sexual desire could be a power stronger than the will of man. The sexually driven marriage on earth is used to imply the salvation and the love of God in heaven. But from a missiological viewpoint, son represents the active lover and daughter represents the passive beloved.</div>

<div btitle="1" p="1" refer1="">(2) Why is God called the Father rather than the Mother?</div>

<div p="1">The word father (אָב) and mother (אֵם) first appear before the fall of man, after Eve is created from a rib of Adam, and within the context of the pair of a man (אִישׁ) and a wife (אִשָּׁה). (Gen 2:24) Originally, father and mother contain the meaning of a perfect family within four basic members.</div>

<div p="1">Eve originally is called &quot;woman&quot; by both God (Gen 2:22) and Adam (Gen 2:23). The context clearly shows that &quot;woman&quot; has two meanings before the fall of man: a) the helper of Adam (Gen 2:18) b) the part of Adam.(Gen 2:21) The primitive root word of woman (אִשָּׁה) is man ( אִישׁ ).The primitive root of man ( אִישׁ ) means to be weak, sick, frail. Initially, the difference between the woman and man is not determined by gender or sex but by its role and origin.</div>

<div p="1">The feature of gender first is exposed on woman after the fall of man during the judgment of God. &quot;Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception (הֵרָיוֹן); in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.&quot; (Gen3:16 KJV) For the first time, it shows that woman is different from man because woman contains the concept of conception (הֵרָיוֹן), born and pain and sin.</div>

<div p="1">In spite that the meaning and father and mother are not given in the immediate context, from the mirror of Adam and Eve, it can be concluded that father is like Adam or man, and mother is like woman. A clear role of father is not demonstrated until after the fall of man: the one who first began to live in a tent and raise cattle (Gen 4:20) and the one who first began to play the harp and flute (Gen 4:21) are entitled as &quot;father.&quot; In other word, father has the meaning of originator, creator and inventor.</div>

<div p="1">Originally, Eve is called woman by God (Gen 2:22). Before the fall of mankind, Adam also calls his helper as woman.(Gen 2:23). During the story of the fall of mankind, she is always called as woman. But after the fall of man and the judgment of God, Adam gives his woman a name Eve. (Gen 3:20) Eve means the Mother of all the living. (Gen 3:20) After Eve born the first child Cain (Gen 4:1), the name of Eve is not used any more in the OT. Cain becomes a murder lately. Although the name of Eve only appears twice in the OT, since then, human beings began to have a Mother.</div>

<div p="1">However, Adam did not call himself as the Father of all living. Hence, human beings did not have a Father until Jesus came into the world to call the Lord the heavenly Father. Only Jesus had the right to call the Lord the heavenly Father. Because in the eyes of the Son of man, the relationship between the Father and the Mother is not based on the gender nor sex but based on the Holy Spirit, the sovereignty, holiness and glory, based on the relationship between the creator and the createe, the lover and the lovee. The Father and the Mother are not in the same domain for equal rights. Only the heavenly Father is what human beings should worship and glorify.</div>

<div p="1">From a missiological view point, the four-members family is the mirror of the basic organization of church. Father and mother represent the missionaries, elders and leaders; man and woman represent the community and followers. The relationship between father and mother or man and woman is like the relationship between Jesus and His people. The purpose of family is originally designed for the advent missionary. The filial piety in the ten commandments is actually from the missiological purpose.</div>

<div p="1">After the fall of man, son and daughter, brother and sister are introduced into the family and are separated out from man and woman. They mirror the advent church community in OT and become clear in NT. After Jesus fufiled His mission through redemption, with His multiple sonships, the son of man and the only Son of the Heavenly Father, all sons and daughters of the Mother can return back to be the children of God.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(4) Why is Jesus the Son of the God?</div>

<div>As it is the created beings and it is filled with sin, it is hard for mankind to believe in Jesus Christ--the super-center of the universe. It has to be a progressive process under the revelation of God from the OT to the NT, first, to know the concept of human son, then to trace up to the heavenly Father and finally to be able to perceive the Holy Spirit. However, to better understand the Son of God, it would have to discuss it through a way of the Trinity.</div>

<div>As the number of generations is getting more and more, it&#39;s getting harder and harder to trace back the ancestors; people who know ancestors becomes less and less. Accordingly the innate capability of knowing God is getting weaker and weaker until it was totally lost when Jesus came. The simple relationship between the Son and the Father is a shortcut for the long and broken lineage from the individual, to parents, to grandparents, to all ancestors, to Adam, and to God.</div>

<div>Jesus is a son of man. Not all people love their parents, but all people love children even they rebel. (Mat 7:9-10) In many cultures such as China and India, to have a child, especially a boy, is considered as auspicious sign in family life. Usually, people prefer children over their parents. Children are the hope and future of parents. As long as children have a bright future, parents would not concern their bitterness and desperation and death. Abraham&#39;s top desire from God is to have a boy. Parents could get proud if their children are extraordinary. These human natures make it easy for man to allow Jesus to come into life. Jesus is a son man. Everyone can have Jesus since He is the Son of man to allow freely to adopt. As a son of man, Jesus will never make those who adopt him disappointed. The story of Jesus is the story of the son of man. Everyone who has Jesus has everything&mdash;the glory of the Father, the love of God, the hope of future, the eternal life. &quot;Whoever has the Son has the eternal life; whoever does not have the Son does not have the eternal life&quot; (1John 5:12)</div>

<div>Not all people can experience the parenthood, but all can experience childhood. The son of man is a purified paradigm that has all nature of all children. Jesus can be understood by all people without high level of education. Jesus is not a superman who merely makes people admirable. He is the one that everyone can follow him. Jesus is weaker and poorer than all children. &quot;A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,&quot; (Mat12:20 NIV) Everyone can follow Him as long as he is willing.</div>

<div>Jesus is not only the son of man but also the Son of God. He has all properties of both the children and the son of Father. Since the Son of God inherits all properties from God, hence, Jesus also has all properties both children and God. Everyone who follows Him can reach God. Man can only reach God through Him. God can only save man through Him. God&#39;s redemption plan can only be fulfilled through Him. Jesus said, &quot;No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; (Jhn14:6 ESV)</div>

<div>In theory, son and father are two completely separated concepts, but in reality, a son and a father cannot be divided at anytime at all. &quot;The Father would not be Father unless he had a Son, and the Son would not be Son unless he has a Father.&quot;<sup pg="66" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> &quot;He was with God in the beginning.&quot; (Jhn1:2 NIV) When a person can switch focus from a worldly son to Jesus Christ, he is able to see the heavenly Father. Jesus said, &quot;Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.&quot; (Jhn14:9 ESV) If a person did not know Jesus, he could not know the Father. Jesus said, &quot;You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&quot; (Jhn 8:19 ESV) Between the Son and the Father, it is much easier for human beings to understand a son than God. As the human lineage is getting longer and longer, the capability to know God is weaker and weaker until totally lost. As a matter of fact, human beings cannot see or understand God directly at all because He is holy.</div>

<div>To have Jesus as the son of man is not to be the father of the son. Instead, to have the son of man is to learn from the son and to return back to be like a son and to follow the spirit of the son. Following needs a correct direction. To follow the son of man is not to imitate the childish enthusiasm, a childish outburst, naive temper, looks or behaviors but about the Holy Spirit. Children need to grow up not just physically in body, but more essentially in spirit to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Jesus said: &quot;I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (Mat18:3 NIV) What Jesus implied is about the properties of children who are the poor spirit, those who mourn, the meek, hunger and thirst not for the bread and milk but for the righteousness, who are merciful, pure in heart, the peacemakers, malstreated because of the righteousness. (Mat 5:1-10)</div>

<div>A difference between the Son and the Father is that the Son inherits the Father rather than that the Father inherits the Son. &quot;The Son is the Son because he is begotten from the Father and proceeds from the Father by way of generation.&quot; <sup pg="65" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> &quot;The Father is the Father because he is the unbegotten&quot;<sup pg="54" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> The Son is the son of the Father, he is not the son of the Holy Spirit; the Father is the father of the Son, he is not the father of the Holy Spirit. However, both the Son and the Father share the same Holy Spirit. The Son and the Father are idential in that the Son inherits everything from the Father in the Holy Spirit.</div>

<div>On the basis of an understanding of human begetting, analogous content can be derived in applying the term &#39;generation&#39; <sup pg="65" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> It seems in the world that the Son is the next generation of the Father. The Father is the first, the Son is the second. It is in compliance with the relationship between man and the Lord, the createe and the creator. However, in the kingdom of heaven, there is no time, no history, no space, no logic, no grammatical tense(past, present and future). Jesus said, &quot;Heaven and earth will pass away,&quot; (Mak13:31 NIV) &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot; (Rev22:13 ESV) &quot;But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.&quot; (Mat19:30 NIV) The Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end, are all in one.</div>

<div>If the Son&#39;s Holy Spirit is considered as the only Way for man to seek God, then the Father&#39;s Holy Spirit is the ultimate destination that is the perpetual Truth. The bondage between the Son&#39;s Father and the Father&#39;s Son, which is the love(agape) of God, is essentially the deployed eternal life. Jesus said that &quot;I am the Way, the Truth and the Life&quot; (John 14:6) What Jesus said about the Way, the Truth and the Life is essentially the same as the trinity (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit) but in a a human understandable expression. Unless to intoduce the concept of trinity, otherwise, Jesus, the Son of the heavenly Father, cannot be well articulated and understood.</div>

<div>From a perspective of a state, if the only Way of man in the world is considered as the Liberty, the truth that man seek is the happiness, then what the Son and the Father bring about is the everlasting human life. This leads to the United States Decaration of Independence (1776): &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evidece, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&mdash;that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...&quot;</div>

<section>
<div p="1">Huiosology will discuss the son independently but from various perspectives and approaches including OOM. The attribute of son includes: ontology, parents, gender, age, personality, born, life (new, eternal), righteousness.</div>

<div p="1">OOM is a method based on the observation of the organization of the world -- the world is composed of various types of numerous objects. Its successful application in software industry can help to prove that OOM is an appropriate approach that fit the nature. It could be a way of how God created the world. At least OOM did not contradict in any perspective to the Genesis about the creation of the world. OOM has already been applied in ontology, biology, liguistics and many other disciples. To apply OOM into theology is still relatively new<sup pg="chap2" title="GrahamHarman2018book">[]</sup>. But this paper finds that applying OOM into huiosology not only can better understand the biblical meaning of son but also can simplify the discussion about the huiosology. 1. Gender neutrality. 2. relationship based. 3. perspective of ontology (study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality. It is part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics.)</div>

<div subpagesize="0.5"><a id="uid16" name="uid16" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Gender of &quot;Son&quot;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1"><a>Gender&nbsp;is a significant harassment for people to better understand the Son of man, the Son of God and the heavenly Father.&nbsp; As soon as a person enters into the puberty around teenage, the sex&nbsp;will began to affect his life until his death. In today&#39;s society, the happiness, the social status, the career, the wealthy, the healthy, the sin/crimals, the faith or&nbsp;the fate of life are all directly or indirectly related to&nbsp;sex. The top&nbsp;popular sin&nbsp;of US&nbsp;is not the idoltry, murder or&nbsp;steal but the adultery. When the concept of son comes into the mind, the first sense for people today&nbsp;is about the&nbsp;male sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></div>

<div p="1">In the OT, there is no such word &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;gender&quot; in Hebrew. In the KJV, the word that was translated as&nbsp;&quot;gender&quot; is <em>raba</em> (רָבַע)&nbsp;in Hebrew, which means: to lie stretched out, lie down. (Lev 18:23, 19:19, 20:16). In NT, the word that was translated as &quot;gender&quot; is gennao (&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;ά&omega;) in Greek, it means I. of men who fatherred children, to be bron, to be begotten. II. metaph, to engender, cause to arise, excite. Of God making Chrrist his son, or making men his sons through faith in Christ&#39;s work. (2Tim 2:23)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Although&nbsp;there is no concept of gender and sex in the Bible, the term of male (זָכָר,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen34">zakar</em>) and female (נְקֵבָה,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen40">neqebah</em>) began to appear&nbsp;as early as in the creation time (Gen1:27).&nbsp; The root word of female (נְקֵבָה,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen40">neqebah</em>) comes from (נָקַב,&nbsp;<em id="yui-gen43">naqab) which means I.</em>to pierce, perforate, bore, appoint and II.&nbsp;to curse, blaspheme, which has nothing to do with sex.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">When God create the first man Adam (Gen 2:7), God did not mention if Adam is male or female. When God made the first woman from Adam, the attribute of woman is the helping, which is not&nbsp;associated sex male or female. Adam called his helper as woman because she was made from him, not because of the gender or sex.&nbsp; After the fall of man, Adam called his helper as Eve, because Eve would become the mother of all the living, not because of the sex. When Eve became pregnant and gave&nbsp;birth (4:1), the character of woman Eve became clear: woman is made of man, the helper of man, the&nbsp;labor of child. However, the sex&nbsp;is still not associated with woman -- it is still not clear if man or woman is male or female.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The sexual related sin is adultery (נָאַף, naaph, x31, to commit adultery), is one of the ten commandment (Exo&nbsp;20:14) In Greece, adultery (&mu;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&epsilon;ύ&omega;, moicheuo)</div>

<div p="1">(3) Father and Son are indivisible. To know only one of them is not&nbsp;knowing. To merely focus on one of them is to deny both of them.</div>

<div p="1">(4) Father and Son are not two individuals but as a whole, the&nbsp;holy Spirit. Father and Son are&nbsp;the true enerral love in holy Spirit.
