Just what is the Canon of Sacred Scripture?
The Canon of Scripture is the comprehensive list of the sacred writings – called books – which the Church has actually identified with Apostolic Tradition. The Canon consists of 46 books of the Old Testament and 27 of the New.  It must be emphasized here that the Bible – Sacred Scripture – is a Catholic Book,  It was the Catholic Church that preserved the Bible through the centuries  prior to the printing press being invented sometime in the 14th to 15th century. It was the Catholic Church who in the year 397, held a Council – The Council of Carthage – that determined which books were deemed to be true and would make up Sacred Scripture.  And, it was the Catholic Church that continued to preserve these 73 books of the bible, through the centuries until the invention of the printing press.

After the printing press came into being, history shows that a number of persons started putting their own spin on the bible. One of the key figures in this was Martin Luther. This resulted in a truncated version of the bible know as the Protestants’ Bible which has only 66 books. You can read more about this by clicking here.

canonical 

As a Presbyterian coming from a reformed tradition, we would see the canon of scripture defined by the Hebrew Bible which is received by the Jewish community as the books which represent the "rule of faith" for the community In addition, we accept the 27 Greek books called the New Testament as the books inspired by God to represent the unchanging teaching of the Apostles.

Apocrypha

II. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and, therefore, are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings. (Chapter One)

So while these books are not seen as being part of inspired scripture they may as any human books have useful information in them. 

heretical

Only when statements in these books would make statements contrary to the Hebrew Bible and New Testament would such statements be considered "heretical." We would not see the whole books as such.

These books, for instance, may provide useful historical information on the thinking of the Jews from the end of the Hebrew Bible to the beginning of the New ( a period of about 400 years. ) So we would not see the entire books as heretical.
