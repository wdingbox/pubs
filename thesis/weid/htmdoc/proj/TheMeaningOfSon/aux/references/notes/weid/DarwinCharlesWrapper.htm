<br />
  Variability.<br />
  Individual Differences.<br />
  Doubtful species.<br />
  Wide ranging, much diffused, and common species vary most.<br />
  Species of the larger genera in any country vary more than the species
  of the smaller genera.<br />
  Many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being
  very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having
  restricted ranges.<br /><br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<a href="#chap03">CHAPTER 3. STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.</a><br />
<br />
  Bears on natural selection.<br />

  Rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants.<br />
  Nature of the checks to increase.<br />
  Competition universal.<br />
  Effects of climate.<br />
  Protection from the number of individuals.<br />
  Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature.<br />

</p>

<p class="noindent">
<a href="#chap04">CHAPTER 4. NATURAL SELECTION.</a><br />
<br />
  Natural Selection: its power compared with man&rsquo;s selection, its power
  on characters of trifling importance, its power at all ages and on
  both sexes.<br />
  Sexual Selection.<br />
  On the generality of intercrosses between individuals of the same
  species.<br />
  Circumstances favourable and unfavourable to Natural Selection,<br />
  namely, intercrossing, isolation, number of individuals.<br />
  Slow action.<br />
  Extinction caused by Natural Selection.<br />

  Extinction, on the descendants from a common parent.<br />

<br />
  Effects of external conditions.<br />
  Use and disuse, combined with natural selection; organs of flight and
  of vision.<br />
  Acclimatisation.<br />
  Correlation of growth.<br />
  Compensation and economy of growth.<br />
  False correlations.<br />
  Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures variable.<br />

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
