<p><span style="color:#d35400;">species are the modified descendants of other species</span>;</p>

<p>The sole object of this work is to consider, firstly, whether man, like every other species, is descended from some pre-existing form;</p>

<p>secondly, the manner of&nbsp; his development; and</p>

<p>thirdly, the value of the differences between the so-called races of man.</p>

<p><span style="color:#d35400;">It has often and confidently been asserted, that man&#39;s origin can never be known</span>: but ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science. The conclusion that <span style="color:#d35400;">man is the co-descendant with other species of some ancient</span>, lower, and extinct form, is not in any degree new.</p>

<p>Many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, coffee, and spirituous liquors: they will also, as I have myself seen, smoke tobacco with pleasure.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God.</p>

<p>On the contrary there is ample evidence, derived not from hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided with savages, that numerous races have existed and still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea.51 The question is of course wholly distinct from that higher one, whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe; and this has been answered in the affirmative by the highest intellects that have ever lived.</p>

<p><strong>The belief in spiritual agencies would easily pass into the belief in the existence of one or more gods. For savages would naturally attribute to spirits the same passions, the same love of vengeance or simplest form of justice.</strong><br />
[weid] Darwin considers the religion and spiritual agencies as a result of part of natural selection -- a way to survive in the fierce compitition.&nbsp; Materials determined the <em>consciousness</em>. <em>consciousness</em> is the reflection of materials.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The feeling of religious devotion is a highly complex one, consisting of love, complete submission to an exalted and mysterious superior, a strong sense of dependence,54 fear, reverence, gratitude, hope for the future, and perhaps other elements. No being could experience so complex an emotion until advanced in his intellectual and moral faculties to at least a moderately high level.</strong></p>

Darwin is a sample of the failure of missionary -- to force people to believe in the Lord will lead to rebel.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The same high mental faculties which first led man to believe in unseen spiritual agencies, then in fetishism, polytheism, and ultimately in monotheism, would infallibly lead him, as long as his reasoning powers remained poorly developed, to various strange superstitions and customs. Many of these are terrible to think of&mdash;such as the sacrifice of human beings to a blood-loving god; the trial of innocent persons by the ordeal of poison or fire; witchcraft, &amp;c.&mdash;yet it is well occasionally to reflect on these superstitions, for they shew us what an infinite debt of gratitude we owe to the improvement of our reason, to science, and our</p>

<p>[weid] Darwin considers the fetishism, polytheism, monotheism, superstitions etc as a result of mental faxtulties rather than the fall of man -- devolution of man.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These miserable and indirect consequences of our highest faculties may be compared with the incidental and occasional mistakes of the instincts of the lower animals.</p>

<p>firstly, the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The simialirity of animal and man is to show the greatness of the love of the Lord. Jesus never deny the similairty: Father will always give food his son when son asked, no matter the Havenly father. Math 7:9-11. What Jesus said is to refer to animal created, but what animal instinct is to glorify the heavenly Father.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When a man risks his life to save that of a fellow-creature, it seems more appropriate to say that he acts for the general good or welfare, rather than for the general happiness of mankind.</strong> No doubt the welfare and the happiness of the individual usually coincide; and a contented, happy tribe will flourish better than one that is discontented and unhappy. We have seen that at an early period in the history of man, the expressed wishes of the community will have naturally influenced to a large extent the conduct of each member; and as all wish for happiness, the &quot;greatest happiness principle&quot; will have become a most important secondary guide and object; the social instincts, including sympathy, always serving as the primary impulse and guide. Thus the reproach of laying the foundation of the most noble part of our nature in the base principle of selfishness is removed; unless indeed the satis-</p>

<p>The expression of the wishes and judgment of the members of the same community, at first by oral and afterwards by written language, serves, as just remarked, as a most important secondary guide of conduct, in aid of the social instincts, but sometimes in opposition to them. This latter fact is well exemplified by the Law of Honour</p>

<p><strong>The ennobling belief in God is not universal with man;</strong> and the belief in active spiritual agencies naturally follows from his other mental powers. The moral sense perhaps affords the best and highest distinction between man and the lower animals; but I need not say anything on this head, as I have so lately endeavoured to shew that the social instincts,&mdash;<strong>the prime principle of man&#39;s moral constitution</strong>39&mdash;<strong>with the aid of active intellectual powers and the effects of habit</strong>, <strong>naturally lead to the golden rule</strong>, <strong>&quot;As ye would that men should do to you, do ye to them likewise;&quot; and this lies at the foundation of morality.</strong></p>

<p>No two individuals of the same race are quite alike. We may compare millions of faces, and each will be distinct.</p>

<p>. <strong>For man is enabled through his mental faculties &quot;to keep with an unchanged body in harmony with the changing universe.&quot; He has great power of adapting his habits to new conditions of life. </strong>He invents weapons, tools and various stratagems, by which he procures food and defends himself. When he migrates into a colder climate he uses clothes, builds sheds, and makes fires; and, by the aid of fire, cooks food otherwise indigestible. He aids his fellow-men in many ways, and anticipates future events. Even at a remote period he practised some subdivision of labour.</p>
