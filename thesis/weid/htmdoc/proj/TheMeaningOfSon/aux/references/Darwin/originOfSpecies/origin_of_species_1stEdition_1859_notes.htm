<div>a certain <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> number of generations</div>

<div>Although much remains <span style="color:#d35400;">obscure</span>, and will long remain <span style="color:#d35400;">obscure</span>,&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="color:#d35400;">Unknown</span> Origin of our Domestic Productions.</div>

<div>The laws governing inheritance are quite <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span>;</div>

<div>these very species have since all become extinct or <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span>.&nbsp;So many <strong>strange</strong> contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.</div>

<div>Variability is governed by many <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> laws, more especially by that of correlation of growth.</div>

<div>It is, however, far more necessary to bear in mind that <strong>there are many <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> laws of correlation of growth</strong>, which, when one part of the organisation is modified through variation, and the modifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of the being, will cause other modifications, often of the most unexpected nature.</div>

<div>now supposed to be extinct and unknown</div>

<div>supposed to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> genus.</div>

<div>may be wholly due to <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> laws of correlated growth</div>

<div>It further deserves notice that these variable characters, produced by man&rsquo;s selection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> to us, more to one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.</div>

<div>acted on by similar <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> influences</div>

<div>under <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> favourable conditions</div>

<div>I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters, is&mdash;that there is a <i>tendency</i> in the young of each successive generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency, from <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> causes, sometimes prevails.</div>

<div>Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some other <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> form, both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the new form.</div>

<div>had become extinct or were unknown</div>

<div>considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct and <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> is very small,</div>

<div>primarily arisen from the above or other <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> causes</div>

<div>by the same <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> causes</div>

<div>the nature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes wholly <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> to us</div>

<div>the use of which is quite unknown</div>

<div>simply incidental or dependent on <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> differences</div>

<div>And as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses, are incidental on <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> differences, chiefly in their reproductive systems.</div>

<div>Both series of facts seem to be connected together by some common but <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> bond, which is essentially related to the principle of life.</div>

<div>unknown differences in their vegetative systems</div>

<div>is incidental on <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> differences in their reproductive systems.</div>

<div>But this is a wholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> progenitor; and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants.</div>

<div>an <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> common parent.</div>

<div>but when the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by some <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> deed of violence.</div>

<div>but for transport across the sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly unknown.</div>

<div>Other and <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> agencies probably have also played a part.</div>

<div>Yet there must be, on my view, some unknown, but highly efficient means for their transportal.</div>

<div>Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either gives some <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most like each other.</div>

<div>these have descended from a species which existed at an <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> anterior period.</div>

<div>or these parents from their ancient and <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> progenitor.</div>

<div>therefore we may readily believe that the <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebrae; the <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> progenitor of the articulata, many segments; and the <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> progenitor of flowering plants, many spiral whorls of leaves.</div>

<div>y <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> epochs in the world&rsquo;s history</div>

<div>unknown means of dispersal</div>

<div>Although much remains obscure, and will long remain <span style="color:#d35400;">obscure</span>, I can entertain no doubt&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>which must be taken to indicate some <span style="color:#d35400;">unknow</span> factor</div>

<div>In all cases of reversion, characters are transmitted through two, three, or many generations, and are then under certain <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> favourable conditions developed.</div>

<div>for some <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> purpose</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>[wie]&nbsp;</div>

<div>Darwin admitted that there were some <span style="color:#d35400;">unknow</span> factor, causes,&nbsp;<span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> genus,&nbsp;<span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> influences in his theory, including&nbsp;&nbsp;u<span style="color:#d35400;">nknown</span> Origin of our Domestic Productions; unknown laws of governing inheritance; unknown law of Variability and&nbsp;correlation of growth and so on.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Although much remains <span style="color:#d35400;">obscure</span>, and will long remain <span style="color:#d35400;">obscure</span>,&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;each species as descended from some other known or&nbsp;<span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> form,</div>

<div>these very species have since all become extinct or <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span>.&nbsp;</div>

<div>under <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> favourable conditions</div>

<div>&nbsp;a certain <span style="color:#d35400;">unknown</span> number of generations,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
