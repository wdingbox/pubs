<div p="">In the OT, the word &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; first appear in Genesis 2 right after Adam and Eve met each other after they were created respectively by God.&nbsp;&quot;For this reason (עַל־כֵּן) a man (אִישׁ) will leave (עָזַב) his father (אָב) and mother (אֵם) and be united (דָּבַק) to his wife (אִשָּׁה), and they will become one flesh (בָּשָׂר).&quot; (Gen2:24 NIV)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">God call male and female, Adam call them man and woman.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">in Gen5. adam and Adam are two diffent world.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The main similarities between the two creation accounts are they both state that humans are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). They also show that God created a perfect world, &quot;God saw that everything he had made, it was very good&quot; (Genesis 1:31). In both accounts, it shows that God is the creator of everything, &quot;in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1) &quot;the Lord God made the earth and the heavens&quot; (Genesis 2:4).</div>

<div p="1">The main differences between the two accounts are Genesis 1 focuses on the creation of the earth but Genesis 2 focuses on the creation of human beings. Genesis 1 is more formal as it is structured in paragraphs according to each day whereas Genesis 2 is more personal, &quot;every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat&quot; (Genesis 2:16). Another difference is the order of creation, in Genesis 1, animals were created first (Genesis 1:20-25). However, in Genesis 2, the creation of man is mentioned before the creation of animal life.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">If Gen2:24 were&nbsp;from Moses (narrator)&nbsp;inspired by God,&nbsp;then the concept of parents would be limited inside&nbsp;the comunication context between&nbsp;Moses and&nbsp;his&nbsp;audence or readers,&nbsp;including the believers or non-belivers in the culture. To leave parents would&nbsp;be a command for non-believers, like Jesus said. &#39;follow me and let the dead to bury the dead&#39; Mat8:22. It also could be&nbsp;predictions of the story of Abraham Gen12:1, where parents&#39; house&nbsp;refers to the cultural sinful world. Man must leave the old world to seek a new world -- which is what Jesus meant in Jhn4, &#39;to be reborn&#39; in the kingdom of God through Spirit to&nbsp;unify with the bridegroom, Jesus Christ. There are no exegetical or gramma confliction&nbsp;issue&nbsp;in&nbsp;this case, however, the biblical meaning of parents can hardly be expositioned.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">If Gen2:24 were&nbsp;from mouth of Adam, then the concept of parents would have to come from the brain of Adam. The description about how Adam gave names of animals (Gen2:19-20),&nbsp;was inserted in Gen2, right before the verses about how woman was created (Gen2:21-22), as well as the first time appearance of &#39;man&#39;&#39; (esh), &#39;woman&#39; (esha),&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; in the Scripture,&nbsp; infer that these terms&nbsp;were originally named by Adam through the Holy Spirit. Adam was directly created and educated by God (Gen2:16-17). Adam knew about God more than Eve, and super more than anyone else among his offsprings of all his generations in human history. Meeting&nbsp;a new&nbsp;friend similar to himself, could be the most exciting event for Adam in his life after enduring the loneliness and helpless (Gen2:22b) for long time -- naming the numerious animals is not&nbsp;an easy task for Adam.&nbsp;This could lead him to speak out the the surprising words. These words&nbsp;become&nbsp;the last precious words&nbsp;for people today&nbsp;to better understand Adam before his fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">From Gen2:23, it can be found that, when Adam first time saw Eve, he could immediately recognize her who she was and knew where she was from without the need of any introduction. This shows that, although Adam could not know how Eve was created in detail, since he was sleeping at that time,&nbsp;Adam clearly knew who created her.&nbsp;Particulary, Adam could understand&nbsp;the reason why she was created -- she was created for him --&nbsp;he would not be thirsty and lonely in spirit any more.&nbsp;Adam could feel that God could understand his heart.&nbsp;At that moment, Adam could be filled with the love of God, mixed with the love of Eve and with the joy in his heart -- the first and the strongest emotion in humam beings.&nbsp;Being inspired by the Holy Spirit, as a first response in the world in thanksgiving for God, Adam cried out &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; from his mouth promptly, and probably with the first tears of humanity. &#39;Father&#39; expressed the thanks&nbsp;of Adam to God;&nbsp;&#39;mother&#39; represented&nbsp;the thanks for and of&nbsp;Eve to&nbsp;God, since Eve could hardly speak yet.&nbsp;&quot;Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts (Adam) , the Spirit who calls out, &quot;Abba (<a id="H_G_Gal_4_6">&alpha;&beta;&beta;&alpha;)</a>, Father.&quot;&nbsp;(Gal4:6 NIV) From Hebrew word father (אָב), to Greek father (<a id="H_G_Gal_4_6">&alpha;&beta;&beta;&alpha;)</a>, to English &#39;father&#39; &nbsp;or &#39;Abba&#39; &nbsp;not only the meaning, but also the sound or IPA (The International Phonetic Alphabet) keeps the same.&nbsp;The words&nbsp;became the terms and are used until today.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">It is inarguable&nbsp;that Adam loves Eve. Before the fall, in Genesis 2, Adam initially used the name &#39;isha&#39; (woman) to call his companion all the time. The name &#39;Eve&#39; was given after the fall and after they were judged&nbsp;(Gen3:20) but before they were driven out of Eden. The word &#39;Eve&#39; was also the last word that Adam could give in Eden.&nbsp;In Genesis 1, God is called &#39;Elohim&#39;, Only in Genesis 2, God is expressed as in pairs of two words &#39;YHWY&nbsp;Elohim&#39;.&nbsp;Many evidence can show&nbsp;the connection between Eve&nbsp;and yhwy.&nbsp; It infers&nbsp;that&nbsp;Adam gave her a name &#39;Eve&#39; in memory of his happiest&nbsp;day before the fall. It was the love of Adam that led him to had three children later (Gen4:1-2). Although Adam betrayed Eve&nbsp;in front of God during the time when he was&nbsp;judged, Adam still loved Eve in his heart until his death at 930 years old --&nbsp;Adam did not have any other wifes in his life.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">after the fall,&nbsp;.&nbsp; What a&nbsp;tragedy.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;Adam loved Eve too much, &#39;leave father and mother&#39;, cleave to &#39;woman&#39;. He indulge in marriage life.&nbsp;&nbsp;This could led him to Eve to make her to eat forbidden fruits.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1"><br />
&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(1) father and mother two individuals refer to one God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam and Eve are&nbsp;the only two individuals created directly in hands of God. Adam and Eve are the first pair and the only pair created by God.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam knew more about God than Eve due to the creation features.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam&nbsp;knew of God more than every one else including Eve in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">compared with all others,&nbsp;Adam is closest to God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam named many, did he name God?</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam knew of God at least from two perspectives: &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are part of the likeness of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam knew of God from his personal feeling or experience&nbsp;and from Eve,&nbsp;the other half part of himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The one unit of two individuals of Adam and Eve is the man what God created.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Each individual cannot be the full&nbsp;man that bears image and likeness of God.</div>

<div p="">Only the pair of A&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Gen2:7 marks&nbsp;the&nbsp;fulfilment of&nbsp;Gen1:26 - the first step of creation of man (COM). Adam represented both an individual man and the abstract species of human being.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is both a concrete individual and the abstract mankind.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Gen2:24 marks the&nbsp;the fulfilment of&nbsp;Gen1:27 - the second step of the creation of man:&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam represent&nbsp;both an individual&nbsp;&#39;male&#39; man as contrast to&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; and also the collective mankind including both male and female.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam can not fullly know of God individually.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">To know God when both Adam and Eve with&nbsp;oneness can know God&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">It is only when Adam and Eve become one flesh&nbsp;that Adam can know of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam represent the likeness of God in &#39;male&#39; style. Eve represent the likeness of God in &#39;female&#39; style.</div>

<div p="">Only when Adam and Eve become oneness, they, as one man, can be likeness of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Eve commited sin first, Adam commit sin second.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&quot;From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.&quot; (Act17:26 NIV) &#39;One man&#39; have to refer to both Adam and the oneness of Adam and Eve.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">After Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the quality of bones and flesh are toxified.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Gen2:24 is the last word that Adam left before the fall of man.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">It is both the present tense and future tense. can be considered as a command.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">to leave father and mother, infer to leave the world of heaven to come to the world of the earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">to leave God, to commit the mission of God on earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">To rule over the creature moving on the earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">father represents the &#39;male&#39; part of the likeness of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Juust like Adam represent both male and mankind including both male and female,&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">father represent both the image of God, but also the likenss of God,</div>

<div p="">father represent both the likeness of both in &#39;male&#39;&nbsp; but also the both male and female.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam can represent both, Eve cannot reprresent the both.</div>

<div p="">father can represent all, mother cannot represent all.&nbsp; although they are in oneness.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">There is no goddess, God have both charaters of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;, but the concept of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are not based on the concept of sex in culture, but based on God&#39;s&nbsp;plan of the redemption.</div>

<div p="">This could explain why God made covenant with Abraham through&nbsp;circumscation, which is the most shameful ritural in all cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">This could the reason why Jesus call God as heavenly father rather than mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Jesus was the son of God, rather than the daughter of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">After Adam and Eve were created and united as oneness (Gen2:24), the creation of man was&nbsp;done but not yet. man&nbsp;is now in the middle of process to be fruitfu,&nbsp;to increase the number, to subdue the earth, to rule over the creatures moving on the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

The Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion founded in 1867. While there is no clear timeline for the changes, religious leaders at the denomination&rsquo;s recent triennial conference in Austin have agreed to a demand to replace the masculine terms for God such as &ldquo;He&rdquo; and &ldquo;King&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father.&rdquo;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">There are two parts in this verse. The first part is about the parents. The second part is about the marriage. This verse has been directly quoted and discussed in the NT (Mat19:4-5, Mak10:6-9, Eph5:31-32, 1Co6:16-17). Even Jesus quoted this verse (Mat19:5,&nbsp; Mak10:6-9). However, all of discussion focus on the issue of &#39;marriage&#39;, the later part of the verse. The first part about the parents was rarely questioned and hence seldomly discussed directly&nbsp;in the NT (Mat8:21-22)&nbsp;&quot;Another disciple said to him, &quot;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&quot;&quot; (Mat8:21 NIV)&nbsp;&quot;But Jesus told him, &quot;Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&quot;&quot; (Mat8:22 NIV).&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He replied to him, &quot;Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?&quot;&quot; (Mat12:48 NIV)&nbsp;&quot;For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.&quot;&quot; (Mat12:50 NIV)</div>

<div p="">Two issues for the first part of the verse: (1) who said so? (2) what&nbsp;are&nbsp;the &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; meant to?</div>

<div p="">(1) Who said the words&nbsp;Gen2:24?</div>

<div p="">Because previous verse of Gen2:24 is a quotation from&nbsp;Adam (Gen2:23), also because ancient Hebrew scripture has not quot mark, so there are two possibilities for Gen2:24: (a) it&nbsp;is part of the quotation&nbsp;from&nbsp;Adam. (b) it is not part of quotation but&nbsp;from narrator (Moses).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Among total of thirty English Bible translations with&nbsp;quot mark published after 1900, all versions adopt&nbsp;(b). Literal Standard Version (https://biblehub.com/lsv/genesis/2.htm) only quots the first part of Gen2:23.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The reasons for&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(1) Adam had no parents. He knew nothing about parents. He could not say anything about parents. (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary)</div>

<div p="">(2) Jesus quotes these as spoken by God (Mat19:5) (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary, Benson Commentary)</div>

<div p="">(4) prediction by Moses(Gill&#39;s Exposition of the Entire Bible);&nbsp;<strong>the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God&nbsp;</strong>(Ellicott&#39;s Commentary)</div>

<div p="">(5) &#39;<strong>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; introduces his inference</strong>&#39; :&nbsp;Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Reason for (a)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(1) Adam understood God&#39;s meaning about&nbsp;Eve. (Barnes&#39; Notes)</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Uncertain:</div>

<div p="">Barnes&#39; Notes,&nbsp;Matthew Poole&#39;s Commentary&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Ellicott&#39;s Commentary for English Readers (https://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/2-24.htm): &quot;These are evidently the words of the narrator. Adam names this new product of creative power, as he had named others, but <strong>he knew nothing about young men leaving their father&rsquo;s house for the wife&rsquo;s sake.</strong> Moreover, in <strong>Matthew 19:5, our Lord quotes these words as spoken by God</strong>, and the simplest interpretation of this declaration is that <strong>the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God </strong>to give this solemn sanction to marriage, founded upon Adam&rsquo;s words. The great and primary object of this part of the narrative is to set forth marriage as a Divine ordinance. The narrator describes Adam&rsquo;s want, pictures him as examining all animal life, and studying the habits of all creatures so carefully as to be able to give them names, but as returning from his search unsatisfied. At last one is solemnly brought to him who is his counterpart, and he calls her Ishah, his feminine self, and pronounces her to be his very bone and flesh.

<div>Barnes&#39; Notes on the Bible:</div>

<div>These might be the words of the first man Genesis 2:24. As he thoroughly understood the relation between himself and the woman, there is no new difficulty in conceiving him to become acquainted at the same time with the relationship of son to father and mother, which was in fact only another form of that in which the newly-formed woman stood to himself. The latter is really more intimateand permanent than the former, and naturally therefore takes its place, especially as the practical of the filial tie, - that of being trained to maturity, - is already accomplished, when the conjugal one begins.</div>

<div>But it seems more probable that this sentence is the reflection of the inspired author on the special mode in which the female was formed from the male. Such remarks of the writer are frequently introduced by the word &quot;therefore&quot; (על־כן kēn-‛al). It is designed to inculcate on the race that was to spring from them the inviolable sanctity of the conjugal relation.</div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">In the primeval wedlock one man was joined to one woman only for life. Hence, in the marriage relation the animal is subordinate to the rational. The communication of ideas; the cherishing of the true, the right, the good; the cultivation of the social affections; the spontaneous outflow of mutual good offices; the thousand nameless little thoughts, looks, words, and deeds that cheer the brow and warm the heart; the common care of children, servants, and dependents; the constant and heartfelt worship of the Father of all, constitute the main ends and joys of the married state.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">After the exclamation of the man on contemplating the woman, as bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, and therefore physically, intellectually, and morally qualified to be his mate, we may suppose immediately to follow the blessing of man, and the general endowment of himself and the animals with the fruits of the soil as recorded in the preceding chapter Genesis 1:28-30. The endowment of man embraces every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. This general grant was of course understood by man to exclude the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was excepted, if not by its specific nature, yet by the previous command given to man. This command we find was given before the formation of the woman, and therefore sometime before the events recorded in the second and third clauses of Genesis 1:27. Hence, it preceded the blessing and the endowment. It was not special, however, to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to be intended for other purposes than the food of man, as there are very many other trees that afford no proper nutriment to man. The endowment, therefore, refers to such trees as were at the same time nutritive and not expressly and previously forbidden.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">This chapter is occupied with the &quot;generations, issues or products of the skies and the land,&quot; or, in other words, of the things created in the six days. It is the meet preface to the more specific history of man, as it records his constitution, his provision, his moral and intellectual cultivation, and his social perfection. It brings us up to the close of the sixth day. As the Creator pronounced a sentence of approbation on all that he had made at the end of that day, we have reason to believe that no moral derangement had yet taken place in man&#39;s nature.</span></div>

These are the words of Moses by Divine instinct, or his inference from Adam&rsquo;s words.</div>

<div p="">Gill&#39;s Exposition of the Entire Bible<br />
Therefore shall a man leave his father, and his mother,.... These are thought by some to be the words of Moses, inferring from the above fact, what ought to be among men; and by others, the words of Adam under divine inspiration, <strong>as the father of mankind instructing his sons what to do, and foretelling what would be done in all succeeding ages: though they rather seem to be the words of God himself, by whom marriage was now instituted;</strong></div>

<div>Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges<br />
24. Therefore shall a man, &amp;c.] This verse contains the comment which the narrator makes upon the words of the man in Genesis 2:23. <strong>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; introduces his inference. </strong>As in Genesis 10:9, Genesis 26:33, Genesis 32:32, a sentence beginning with &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; supplies the application, or relation, of the ancient narrative to later times. It is the man who is to leave &ldquo;father and mother,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the woman.&rdquo; Some compare the story in Jdg 15:1, where the woman remains with her family or clan, and Samson comes to live with her. This feature has been thought to illustrate the primitive usage of &ldquo;the matriarchate.&rdquo; But it is unlikely that the Hebrew narrative would contain a reference to such conditions.</div>

<div>Instead of &ldquo;shall leave,&rdquo; the full force of the tense in the Hebrew would be given by &ldquo;doth leave&rdquo; and &ldquo;cleaveth.&rdquo; The sanctity of marital relations is thus referred back to the very birthday of human society, being based on a principle laid down before the Fall.</div>

<div>The relation of the man to his wife is proclaimed to be closer than that to his father and mother. By the words, &ldquo;shall cleave unto his wife &hellip; one flesh,&rdquo; is asserted the sanctity of marriage. Polygamy is not definitely excluded; but the principle of monogamy seems to be implied in the words &ldquo;cleave&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall be one flesh&rdquo;: and this principle is upheld by the prophets as the ideal of marriage, in their representation of the relation of Jehovah and Israel under the metaphor of the married state.</div>

<div>Pulpit Commentary<br />
Verse 24. - Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife. There is nothing in the use of such terms as father and mother, or in the fact that the sentiment is prophetic, to prevent the words from being regarded as a continuation of Adam&#39;s speech, although, on the other hand, the statement of Christ (Matthew 19:5) <strong>does not preclude the possibility of Moses being their author; but whether uttered by the first husband (Delitzsch, Macdonald) or by the historian (Calvin, Murphy), they must be viewed as an inspired declaration of the law of marriage. Its basis (fundamental reason and predisposing cause) they affirm to be</strong></div>

<div>(1) the original relationship of man and woman, on the platform of creation; and</div>

<div>(2) the marriage union effected between the first pair. Its nature they explain to be</div>

<div>(1) a forsaking (on the part of the woman as well as the man) of father and mother - not filially, in respect of duty, but locally, in respect of habitation, and comparatively, in respect of affection; and</div>

<div p="">The image of God has no gender. Regarding the duties assigned to man, gender or sex is not necessary at all.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">God is faithful God. (Duet 7:9) &quot;I will not alter the word that went forth from my lips&quot; (Psa 89:34) &quot;As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.&quot;(Isaiah 55:10-11)</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Based on what God said after He created man, it can be seen that the primary purpose to create male and female is to &quot;Be fruitfule and increase in number; fill the earth&quot; (Gen 1:28) Today human beings think that being fruitful and increasing in number is related to gender and sex. However, in the eyes of God, man are genderless or sex-free. God never said that Adam(אָדָם) is male and Eve (חַוָּה) is female. God called Eve as woman (אִשָּׁה). The word woman (אִשָּׁה) comes from the primitive root word man (אִישׁ), which means &quot;part of man.&quot; Eve is originally called woman. The name of Eve was given by Adam after the fall of man. The word man and woman, the male and female are two pairs of words. But man and male, woman and female are not connected in Hebrew until the circumcision appears (Gen 17:10)</div>

<div p="">The absence of sex in the Hebrew context indicated that the male and female are not determined by sex or gender. The purpose to create male and female is not to create two kinds of human beings based on the gender or sex. In the eyes of God, males and females are one humankind. The distinction between the male and female is the seal of God set on humankind to prepare for human beings to be able to distinguish between son and daughter, the savior and saviee.</div>

<div p="">From this perspective, it can be seen that, what God said to man (Gen 1:28) is exactly the same as what Jesus said to His disciples.(Mat 28:19-20) (a) &quot;God bless them (man)&quot; refers to &quot;Surely I(Jesus) will be with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot; (b) &quot;be fruitful&quot; means &quot;make disciples&quot;, (c) &quot;increase in number and fill the earth&quot; means &quot;throughout all nations and baptizing (fill) them in name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot;, (d) &quot;subdue and rule over&quot; means &quot;teach them to obey everything I (Jesus) have commanded you.&quot; Jesus&#39; Great Commission is not something new but the command of God when man was created in the beginning. The distinction between male and female is the distinction between son and daughter, the Son and man, the disciples and the Gentiles. In the eyes of God, human beings have only two kinds: Christian and non-Christian, like sheep and goat (Mat 25:32)</div>

<div p="1">In a word, male and female are not the trouble makers leading to adultery or pain; instead, God created male and female to prepare for the Son of God to fulfill the salvation plan.</div>
