<div p="">In the OT, the word &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; first appear in Genesis 2 right after Adam and Eve met each other after they were created respectively by God.&nbsp;&quot;For this reason (עַל־כֵּן) a man (אִישׁ) will leave (עָזַב) his father (אָב) and mother (אֵם) and be united (דָּבַק) to his wife (אִשָּׁה), and they will become one flesh (בָּשָׂר).&quot; (Gen2:24 NIV)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Gen2:24 is very special in the Bible. It is directly quoted by Jesus and occurs&nbsp;in the NT at least four times (Mat19:4-5, Mak10:6-9, Eph5:31-32, 1Co6:16-17).&nbsp; It is the earliest scripture about the most complicated relationship among father and mother, man and woman. However, most people focus on the relationship between man and woman, rare people quest&nbsp;after &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; due to preoccupied mindsets, for example,&nbsp;what are&nbsp;&#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39;? are they two or one? are they the parents of man or woman or both? who are they exactly?&nbsp;The dictionary and the following outline of the usage can&nbsp;help&nbsp;but a little.&nbsp;(from blueleterbible)</div>

<p><strong>Quotation Marks Issue</strong></p>

<p>Gen2:24 is located between the Adam&#39;s saying Gen2:23 and the narrative verse Gen2:25. In ancient Hebew scriptures, there was no punctuation or quotation marks. Whether Gen2:24 is part of Adam&#39;s saying is not a problem&nbsp;for biblical&nbsp;scribers. It was&nbsp;not until after the middle of the sixteenth century when quotation marks became popular in the printed Bible translations, whether Gen2:24 came from&nbsp;Adam or not became a prominent&nbsp;issue. Also, because Adam&#39;s speech is a monologue rather than a dialogue, it increased the complexity of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most scholars believe that Gen2:24 came from Moses (narrator). The reasons can be summerized as following:</p>

<p>(1) Adam had no parents. He knew nothing about parents at that time. He could not say anything about parents. It had to be Moses. (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary)</p>

<p>(2) Jesus quotes these as spoken by God (Mat19:5, Mak10:6-9) to prove that these&nbsp;are&nbsp;from&nbsp;narrator rather than Adam (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary, Benson Commentary). Pulpit Commentary sais that &quot;the statement of Christ (Matthew 19:5) does not preclude the possibility of Moses being their author;&quot;</p>

<div>(3) The word &#39;therefore&#39;&nbsp;(<a dir="rtl" id="H_G_Gen_2_24">עַל־כֵּן֙</a>) infers that Gen2:24 is a narratation.&nbsp;&quot;This verse contains the comment which the narrator makes upon the words of the man in Genesis 2:23. <strong>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; introduces his inference. </strong>As in Genesis 10:9, Genesis 26:33, Genesis 32:32, a sentence beginning with &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; supplies the application, or relation, of the ancient narrative to later times. &quot;(Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges). Also, Barnes&#39; Notes on the Bible said, &quot;But it seems more probable that this sentence is the reflection of the inspired author on the special mode in which the female was formed from the male. Such remarks of the writer are frequently introduced by the word &quot;therefore&quot; (על־כן kēn-‛al). It is designed to inculcate on the race that was to spring from them the inviolable sanctity of the conjugal relation.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>A few of scholars believe that Gen2:24 were from Adam. Barnes&#39; Notes on the Bible states, &quot;These might be the words of the first man Genesis 2:24. As he thoroughly understood the relation between himself and the woman, there is no new difficulty in conceiving him to become acquainted at the same time with the relationship of son to father and mother, which was in fact only another form of that in which the newly-formed woman stood to himself. The latter is really more intimate and permanent than the former, and naturally therefore takes its place, especially as the practical of the filial tie, - that of being trained to maturity, - is already accomplished, when the conjugal one begins.&quot;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Some believe that whether Gen2:24 are from Adam or Moses cannot be certain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew Poole&#39;s Commentary: &quot;These are the words of Moses by Divine instinct, or his inference from Adam&rsquo;s words.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Benson Commentary: &quot;It appears by Matthew 19:4-5, that it was God himself who said here, a man must leave all his relations to cleave to his wife; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">but whether he spake this by Moses or by Adam, is uncertain.&quot;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The only agreement&nbsp;is that Gen2:24 are words inspired by the Spirit of God. Ellicott&#39;s Commentary: &quot;<strong>the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God&quot;&nbsp;</strong>Gill&#39;s Exposition of the Entire Bible: &quot;Therefore shall a man leave his father, and his mother,.... These are thought by some to be the words of Moses, inferring from the above fact, what ought to be among men; and by others, the words of Adam under divine inspiration, as the father of mankind instructing his sons what to do, and foretelling what would be done in all succeeding ages: though they rather seem to be the words of God himself, by whom marriage was now instituted;&quot;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Dispite of the discrepancy, it is an interesting and strange phenomenon&nbsp;that all English translations of the Bible unanimously exclude the Gen2:24 out&nbsp;of the Adam&#39;s quotation marks. Only the Literal Standard Version (https://biblehub.com/lsv/genesis/2.htm) differs&nbsp;from others in that, it excludes not only Gen2:24, but also the second half of Gen2:23. &quot;and the man says, &#39;This at last! Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh!&#39;&nbsp;For this is called Woman, for this has been taken from Man;&rdquo; (Gen2:23 LSV) Three relatively independant statements are logically related in Gen2:23-24: (1) this&nbsp;is&nbsp;bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; (2) this is called&nbsp;woman because of (<a dir="rtl" id="H_G_Gen_2_23">כִּ֥י</a>) that;&nbsp;(3) for this reason (<a dir="rtl" id="H_G_Gen_2_24">עַל־כֵּן֙</a>), man shall leave father and mother to unit woman to become one flesh. Due to the continuity of the reasoning clause, LSV believes that, if Gen2:24 was excluded, then the second half part of Gen2:23 should also be excluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Who is &#39;Father&#39; or &#39;Mother&#39;?</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>With regard to the Mosaic laws of the marriage related to Gen2:24,&nbsp;when focusing&nbsp;on the unit and indivisiblilty between husband and wife,&nbsp;the quotation issue seems not important. However, when concerning about how to exposition the biblical meaning of &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39;, the quotation issue becomes crucial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">If Gen2:24 were&nbsp;from Moses (narrator)&nbsp;inspired by God,&nbsp;then the concept of &#39;father and mother&#39; would be limited inside&nbsp;the comunicating&nbsp;context between&nbsp;Moses and&nbsp;his&nbsp;audence or readers&nbsp;in&nbsp;the culture. To leave parents would&nbsp;be simply like a command of God. It is&nbsp;like what God said to Abraham,&quot;Leave ... your father&#39;s household and go to the land I will show you.&quot; (Gen12:1 NIV). Jesus once replied&nbsp;to a&nbsp;disciple&nbsp;filial&nbsp;to his father,&nbsp;&#39;follow me and let the dead to bury the dead&#39; (Mat8:22). Regarding about mother, Jesus once said, &quot;Who is my mother?... For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is ... my mother.&quot;(Mat12:48-50 NIV). In the cultral context, when thinking father and mother geneaologically or biologically,&nbsp;father and mother would&nbsp;refer to the&nbsp;parents&#39; house, the hometown,&nbsp;the credle of civilication of the&nbsp;world. What God wanted man to do is to leave the old world to seek a new world.&nbsp;Such process is like what Jesus said to be reborn in John 4 to unit&nbsp;the bridegroom who is Jesus Christ to enter&nbsp;into the kingdom of heaven. There is no exegetical or theological confliction&nbsp;issue&nbsp;in&nbsp;this case, however, the original biblical meaning about &#39;father and mother&#39;&nbsp;can hardly be expositioned.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Who invented &#39;father,&nbsp;&#39;mother&#39;, &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39;?</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">If Gen2:24 were&nbsp;from mouth of Adam, then the concept of &#39;father&#39;, &#39;mother&#39;,&nbsp; &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; would have to come from the brain of Adam. The description of how Adam gave names of animals (Gen2:19-20),&nbsp;was inserted into Gen2, right before the verses of how woman was created (Gen2:21-22), as well as the first time appearance of&nbsp; &#39;father&#39;, &#39;mother&#39;, &#39;man&#39; (ish) and &#39;woman&#39; (ishah)&nbsp;in the Scripture,&nbsp; all of these suggest that these terms&nbsp;were originally named by Adam under inspiration&nbsp;of&nbsp;God. This context is critical to exposition the biblical meaning of &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother.&#39;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Whom did &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; refer to?</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Adam did not have father&nbsp;and mother.&nbsp;Adam is not the father of Eve even though Eve came from&nbsp;the rib&nbsp;of Adam. Also, Adam did not have any offspring at the time&nbsp;when he&nbsp;first time&nbsp;met Eve --&nbsp;Adam and Eve were not a father and mother yet until they sinned. Adam might observe parents&nbsp;among animals, but&nbsp;Adam&nbsp;had never&nbsp;seen&nbsp;any human father&nbsp;and mother&nbsp;before. The words &#39;father and mother&#39; from Adam&#39;s mouth had to infer to the Creator God at that moment.</div>

<div p="1">Adam was directly created and educated by God (Gen2:16-17). Adam knew of God more than Eve, and super more than anyone else among his offsprings of all his generations in human history. With experiences of&nbsp;naming,&nbsp;being&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;by the Spirit of God, Adam had capability to give names &#39;father&#39; and&nbsp;&#39;mother&#39; for God.</div>

<div p="1">God called the first man He made&nbsp;&#39;Adam&#39; (Gen2:7, Gen3:9). But God did not tell Adam the name of God. What God told Adam is&nbsp;not to eat the forbidden fruit. God did not reveal His name &#39;I am who I am&#39; (אֶֽהְיֶה&nbsp;אֲשֶׁר&nbsp;אֶֽהְיֶה) until Moses asked him (Exo3:14). Adam did not know how to call God. However, God&nbsp;gave&nbsp;Adam the right of freedom of speech. The only restriction for him is not to eat the forbidden fruit. Adam could name all things that he did not know including himself and Eve.&nbsp;Among creatures, only Adam had such privilage right from God to give names for God. This shows a love of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Are &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; two in&nbsp;one?</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Adam knew God more than anyone else. The Scriptures reiterates that there is only one God. There are many reasons that Adam called God &#39;father&nbsp;and mother.&#39;&nbsp; First, calling God &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; does&nbsp;not necessarily mean two persons,&nbsp;nor&nbsp;one personal God with two gender characters. Instead it was a way to distinguish the callers between &#39;man&#39; (ish)&nbsp;and &#39;woman&#39; (ishah). Adam&#39;s&nbsp;self-consciousness was not strong enough yet. Adam even was not able to distinguish clearly between himself and Eve&nbsp;since they had no distinct names but shared the identical flesh and&nbsp;bones with the breath of Yehweh&nbsp;God. It was a great invetion for Adam to be able to call himself &#39;man&#39; (ish) and her (&#39;esha&#39;). Adam did not know how and who Eve&nbsp;was created because&nbsp;he was put in sleep at that time. God led her to Adam but did not told him&nbsp;anything about her (Gen2:22). It could be based upon the eye contacts or other kinds of mutual comunication that made Adam to believe that she was&nbsp;&#39;bones of my bones, flesh of my flesh&#39;. It is likely that Adam refer &#39;father&#39; to the creation of Adam, &#39;mother&#39; to the creation of Eve. Adam called&nbsp;&#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; to honor the one Creator God for two masterpieces of creation.</div>

<div p="1">Second, the pair of terms &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; could be used to distinct between&nbsp;&#39;man&#39; (ish) and &#39;woman&#39; (esha) for&nbsp;the difference&nbsp;between Adam and Eve.&nbsp;Adam called himself man (esh) and God &#39;father&#39; (aba), Adam also defined that Eve should be&nbsp;called &#39;woman&#39; and Eve should call&nbsp;God &#39;mother&#39;. Adam thought that&nbsp;it could help God to distinguish&nbsp;between him and her when both called God. Adam is probably the first one to call God with different names to distinguish between Adam and Eve:&nbsp;&#39;man&#39; (ish) called God &#39;father&#39;, &#39;woman&#39; (ishah) called God mother.&nbsp;This phenonmenon is common in cultural and social history:&nbsp;Islam called God&nbsp;&#39;Allah&#39;, some Hinduism call God &#39;Shiva&#39;, Chinese called God &#39;Shen&#39;, etc.. Having different names of God does&nbsp;not mean&nbsp;that there are many different types of gods, instead, the different names of God reflect the different sorts of man how they identify themself. Among numerous names, &#39;Father&#39; was the earliest name Adam gave to God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Third, Hebrew &#39;Yehweh&nbsp;Elohim&#39; could be a hint&nbsp;why Adam&nbsp;called God &#39;father and mother&#39;. By comparison bewteen&nbsp;Genesis 1 and 2, it can be found that Genesis 1 uses single word &#39;Elohim&#39; to present God, whereas Genesis 2 uses two words &#39;Yehweh&nbsp;Elohim&#39; to present God. Yehweh and Elohim are widely used solitoary elsewhere to represent God in the Scriptures. It is only in Genesis 2 that&nbsp;both are always used together.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an accidence&nbsp;or coincidence. Genesis 1 focuses on the 6-day creation of the world, Genesis 2 focuses on the creation of man (adam): Adam and Eve, as well as the relationship of man (esh) and woman (esha), father and mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;Yehweh&#39; and &#39;Elohim&#39; are two terms for one God. Whereas, the word&nbsp;&#39;adam&#39; is both a collective name for man and a proper&nbsp;name for the first created individual Adam;&nbsp;man (ish) and woman (isha) are two names of two types of one man (adam);&nbsp; father and mother are two names from two types of man for God.&nbsp;It is through the pair of&nbsp;meanings and the pair of words&nbsp;that forms the likeness between the image of God (Yehweh Elohim)&nbsp;and the man (adam and Adam, Adam and Eve, man and woman, father and mother). It was also likely that Adam call &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; under the infleunce of the &#39;Yehweh Elohim&#39;.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Moreover, Yehweh and Eve are closely related both in pronounciation and meanings in Hebrew &#39;to be&#39; and &#39;live&#39; (see table). The name of &#39;Eve&#39; was given by Adam after the fall, which means &#39;the mother of all the living&#39;&nbsp;(3:20).&nbsp; Eve was not merely the mother of man&nbsp;any more but all the living.&nbsp;For Adam, Eve was equilalent to a&nbsp;name of a god. &#39;We cannot understand the history of Eve without seeing her as a deposed Creator-Goddess.&#39;[<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">bookTemplate197book, p3</span>]&nbsp; Genesis 2 could not tell the reason or meaming for both&nbsp;&#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; like the word &#39;woman&#39; did. It was the usage of &#39;mother&#39;&nbsp;in Eve&#39;s&nbsp;name&nbsp;change&nbsp;from&nbsp;&#39;woman&#39; to&nbsp;&#39;Eve&#39; that shed the some light about the original biblical meaning of&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;mother&#39;.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">On the other line, the connection between Adam and&nbsp;&#39;father&#39; is indirectly revealed through Adam&#39;s first born child, the murderer&nbsp;Cain&#39;s family tree (Gen4:20, Gen4:21). A&nbsp;clearer&nbsp;meaning of &#39;father&#39; is demonstrated&nbsp;when God (Elohim)&nbsp;changed&nbsp;the name from&nbsp;Abram to Abraham, Abraham means &#39;the father of many nations&#39; (Gen17:4). It is noticeable that Yehweh and Elohim interplays in Gen17. Yehwey is used in Gen17:1. Elohim is used in Gen17:3 when He made the changes of the name.&nbsp;It is through the changes of names of Eve and Abram&nbsp;by Adam and God respectively that the difference between &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; can be distinct. It can be seen that there are two lines of connections: (1) the connection between &#39;mother&#39; and&nbsp;Eve, the mother of all the living and Yehweh;&nbsp;(2) the connection between &#39;father&#39; and Abram, the father of nations and Elohim. These two lines of connections&nbsp;underlined the connection relationship between God (Yehweh Elohim) and &#39;father and mother.&#39;&nbsp; -- &#39;mother&#39; infers to Yehweh; &#39;father&#39; infers to Elohim. In another word, the distinction between &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; is a similar to the distinction between the name of Yehweh and Elohim.</div>

<div p="1">
<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&#39;Male&#39; or &#39;Female&#39;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">In Genesis 1, God created&nbsp;&#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; in the second step of the creation of man, but the distinct between &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; is not clear in Genesis 1. Although Genesis 2 clearly demostrated the difference between man and woman, and Genesis 3 indirectly&nbsp;articulated the difference between &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mohter&#39;, the differrence between &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; cannot be linked to the difference between man and woman, or father and mother. &quot;male and female&#39; are not even used in Genesis 2 and 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Adam could distinct between man (ish) and woman (ishah), father and mother, but he could not understand the meaning of Male and Femal, nor could he distinct between &quot;Male&#39; and &#39;Female&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;Male&#39; and &#39;Female&#39; are names used by God to distinct two types of man. The unknowing of the meanings of male and female could help to prevent Adam from misuse of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; to link&nbsp;to&nbsp;God when he cried out &#39;father and mother&#39;. &#39;Male&#39; and &#39;Female&#39; cannot be applied to describe one God.</div>

<div p="1">On the other hand, Adam could&nbsp;be associated with&nbsp;man and&nbsp;father but not male; Eve could&nbsp;be associated with woman and mother but not female. In another word,&nbsp;&#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; cannot be associated to man (ish) and woman (eshah), or father and mother respectively until later in a cultural context after the fall. This indicates that Adam and Eve are qualified to be called &#39;man&#39;(ish) and &#39;woman&#39; (esha). But just like Adam and Eve are not qualified to be called &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39;, Adam and Eve are not qualified to be called &#39;male&#39; or &#39;female&#39; yet.</div>

<div p="1">There exists a consistency among the different pairs between Adam and Eve, man and woman, or father and mother -- their differences&nbsp;are not based upon &#39;male&#39; or &#39;female&#39; characters, nor based upon the gender or sex, instead,&nbsp;they are&nbsp;based on the privilage in the creation and duties or responisibilities&nbsp;in missionary of God. Hence, the likeness between the image of God and man is not based upon the gender but based upon the privilage in creation and missionary of God.&nbsp;It is a misuse to associated &#39;male&#39; with &#39;man&#39; (ish) and &#39;father&quot;, and &#39;female&#39; with &#39;woman&#39; (esha) and &#39;motner&#39; in human culture after the fall. It is only after Jesus came into the world, those of brothers and sisters who can follow Him to accomplish the mission of God can be truely called male and female.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The Beauty of the First Love Story</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Meeting a creature&nbsp;similar to himself, could be the most exciting event for Adam in his life after enduring the loneliness and helpless (Gen2:22b) for long time -- at least, naming the numerious animals is not&nbsp;an easy task for Adam, it&#39;s better to have&nbsp;a helper to speak with.&nbsp;For&nbsp;Adam, Eve is more beautiful than&nbsp;scenes of rivers and mountains, more precious than gold or treasures (Gen2:10-14). This could lead him to speak out the the surprising words. These words&nbsp;become&nbsp;the most precious words&nbsp;for people today&nbsp;to better understand Adam before his fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">From Gen2:23, it can be found that, when Adam first time saw Eve, he could recognize her&nbsp; without the need of God&#39;s introduction. This shows that, although Adam could not know how Eve was created in detail, since he was sleeping at that time,&nbsp;Adam clearly knew who created her.&nbsp;Particulary, Adam could understand&nbsp;the reason why she was created -- she was created for him --&nbsp;he would no longer be thirsty and lonely in spirit any more.&nbsp;Adam could feel that God could understand his heart.&nbsp;At that moment, Adam could be filled with the love of God, mixed with the love of Eve and with the joy in his heart -- the first and the strongest emotion in humam beings.&nbsp;Being inspired by the Holy Spirit, as a first response in the world in thanksgiving for God, Adam cried out &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; from his mouth promptly, and probably with the first human tears. &#39;Father&#39; expressed the great thanks&nbsp;of Adam to God;&nbsp;&#39;mother&#39; represented&nbsp;the thanks for and of&nbsp;Eve to&nbsp;God, since Eve could hardly speak yet.&nbsp;&quot;Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts (Adam) , the Spirit who calls out, &#39;Abba (<a id="H_G_Gal_4_6">&alpha;&beta;&beta;&alpha;)</a>, Father.&#39; &quot;&nbsp;(Gal4:6 NIV) From Hebrew word father (אָב), to Greek father (<a id="H_G_Gal_4_6">&alpha;&beta;&beta;&alpha;)</a>, to English &#39;father&#39; &nbsp;or &#39;Abba&#39; &nbsp;not only the meaning, but also the sound or IPA (The International Phonetic Alphabet) keeps the same.&nbsp;The words&nbsp;became the terms and are used globally until today.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Gen 2:24 states that man should leave father and mother. It is consistent to what God&nbsp;commanded Abraham to leave father&#39;s house to go to Canaan (Gen12:1). It is also consistent to Jesus&#39;s teaching.&nbsp;When a disciple said to Jesus to first let him&nbsp;go and bury his&nbsp;father,&nbsp;Jesus told him, &quot;Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&quot;&nbsp;(Mat8:22 NIV). Jesus once said, &quot;Who is my mother, and who are my brothers? For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.&quot;(Mat12:48-50 NIV). Although the context of father and mother is different, from Adam&nbsp;to Abraham, to disciples and Jesus,&nbsp;they all have a common goal&nbsp;to leave father and mother:&nbsp;to unit&nbsp;wife, church, Jesus,&nbsp;to accomplish the mission of God. From this perspective, Gen2:24 is a prototype and a prediction of Jesus&#39; great commition:&quot;Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot;&nbsp;(Mat28:19-20)&nbsp; What Adam and Jesus talked about &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; is identical but different from the cultural&nbsp;flesh concept of the world.</div>

<div p="1">Gen2:24 indicated that it is man (ish), rather than woman (esha), who should&nbsp;or would leave father and mother, and should or would&nbsp;unit woman (esha) rather than man (ish). Adam could distinguish between man (adam) in 2:23&nbsp;and man (ish). God called the first man Adam, but Adam first time to call himself man (ish). By&nbsp;saying&nbsp;so, it has multiple significances. (1) Adam grew up -- he did not think himself a generic&nbsp;man (adam) but a specific kind of man (ish) that is different from woman (esha).&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Adam knew&nbsp;the defference between man (esh) and womon (eshah) over the privilage both in the order of&nbsp;creation but also the in the leading role of&nbsp;missionary of God. Adam considered himself as man (ish). It means that he had&nbsp;admitted and accepted the privilage and all duties and responsibilities that man (ish) should take. (3) The imperfect conjugation of the verb&nbsp; leave (יַֽעֲזָב)&nbsp;and cleave (וְדָבַק) could express not only the potential actions but also the&nbsp;desirability that Adam was willing to take duties to please God. It was the first response of the love of God in human history.&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) As the first created man (adam) and the first man (esh), by calling God &#39;father&#39;, Adam established a sonship relationship with God and&nbsp;became the first son of God.&nbsp;Since then, Adam was not the same as other&nbsp;creatures any more in the world. (5)&nbsp; With the manship and sonship, calling God &#39;father and mother&#39; was a signature and seal under&nbsp;the&nbsp;third party&nbsp;authority and testimony to allow God to legalize the husband-wife relationship between Adam and Eve.&nbsp;Gen2:24 is more than a narrative, command or prediction, but is more&nbsp;like an&nbsp;oath,&nbsp;swear,&nbsp;contract or a divine ordinance in a&nbsp;wedding ceremony in front of Go.&nbsp;(6) Adam should not call God &#39;mother&#39;. Adam&#39;s calling of &#39;mother&#39; was a&nbsp;supplication&nbsp;for Eve. It showed&nbsp;that Adam had determined&nbsp;to protect and take over&nbsp;Eve --&nbsp;Eve does not belong to God but belong to Adam.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">God loved Adam&nbsp;and&nbsp;permitted&nbsp;man (ish) to leave Him&nbsp;to cleave with woman in order to become father and mother.&nbsp;It is likely that God used Adam&#39;s words to build up&nbsp;the first marriage contitution. With imperfect conjugation that can&nbsp;present the future tense,&nbsp;Gen2:24&nbsp;is also like a prediction&nbsp;that Adam and Eve would be the first father and mother according to&nbsp;the&nbsp;likeness of&nbsp;God.</div>

<div p="1">Although Adam actively&nbsp;called God &#39;father&#39; and humblly called God &#39;mother&#39; more or less because of&nbsp;&nbsp;Eve, Adam well played&nbsp;the role of the first born, the elder and the husband and the head of Eve -- Adam can be called a real man (ish) and he is deserved to be called the first&nbsp;son of God. However, Adam eventually failed his swear, and failed to please God.&nbsp;Adam could not be a perfect model until Jesus came into the world to make it&nbsp;up on the cross.&nbsp;It is through the last son of God, Jesus, who eventually pleased God&nbsp;&#39;This is my beloved Son.&#39; (Mat)</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">It is inarguable&nbsp;that Adam loves Eve. Before the fall, in Genesis 2, Adam initially used the name &#39;isha&#39; (woman) to call his companion all the time. The name &#39;Eve&#39; was given after the fall and after they were judged&nbsp;(Gen3:20) but before they were driven out of Eden. The word &#39;Eve&#39; was also the last word that Adam could give in Eden. Before being driven out of Eden, Adam gave&nbsp;his companion the&nbsp;title&nbsp;Eve to express his loyalty and love of Eve -- no matter where they went, the first love would not change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;Eve&#39; could also a name for both of them to keep in memory of his first day of the first love. The connection between the name &#39;Eve&#39; and &#39;Yehweh&#39; could symolize the immortal&nbsp;love as a contrast to their death. Such love is ordained by God.&nbsp;It was the love of Adam that led him to had three children later in the cursed land (Gen4:1-2). Although Adam betrayed (or frankly spoke out) Eve&nbsp;in front of God&nbsp;during the time when he was&nbsp;interrogated, Adam still loved Eve in his heart until his death at 930 years old --&nbsp;Adam did not have any other wifes in his life. Although Adam committed the sin to eat the forbidden fruit, Adam&#39;s marriage from the beginning to the end is deserved to be praised among human beings forever.</div>

<div p="1">The&nbsp;love story of Adam was the first and most divine love story between the first couple in humanity.&nbsp;However, because Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the flesh and bones were toxified inside out. No any other&nbsp;love story can compare with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;All human loves are&nbsp;replaced with&nbsp;the illusionary driven by chemichal&nbsp;power more or less full of the adultery.&nbsp;Jesus quoted Gen2:24 verse to remind people to re-focus on&nbsp;the very original love and initial marriage rather than to think how to breach the Mosaic Laws (Mat19:5,&nbsp; Mak10:6-9). Jesus took over&nbsp;the love of Adam and replace it with a greater love on the cross. Paul pointed out that the verse Gen2:24 is significant more than the marriage:&nbsp;&quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.&nbsp;This is a profound mystery -- but I am talking about Christ and the church.&quot; (Eph5:31-32 NIV)&nbsp;&quot;But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.&quot; (1Co6:17 NIV)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">If Gen2:24 were&nbsp;from mouth of Adam, the love story of Adam was not over. Because the love story of Adam had a limitation -- it explosed a critical issue: Adam shifted the weight center of the love from&nbsp;God to&nbsp;Eve. After Adam met Eve,&nbsp;Adam fell in love with Eve. After Adam had a helper Eve -- &nbsp;he did not&nbsp;need to fully count on God. As his relationship with Eve became closer and closer,&nbsp;Adam thought he could&nbsp;leave God to unite&nbsp;with Eve. Between Eve and God, Adam would rather&nbsp;to choose Eve.&nbsp;Eve was the individible part of the life of Adam. Adam could no longer live without Eve.&nbsp;Eve became a god&nbsp;rather a helper of Adam. From the unique proper&nbsp;name &#39;Eve&#39; given by Adam, which means the mother of all living things (Gen3:20), it can be found that Adam at last shifted his life center of the world view&nbsp;from God to&nbsp;Eve -- Adam&nbsp;put&nbsp;Eve in a position above&nbsp;God:&nbsp;It was Eve who was the oiginator or creator of all living things rather than God or &#39;mother&#39; Adam&nbsp;called God for Eve.&nbsp;Such issue was corrected by God through the changes of the name of Abram to Abraham, Abraham means the father of many nations.(Gen17:1)</div>

<div p="1">Superficially, it was the fault of Eve who ate the forbidden fruit.&nbsp; Essentially the fault came from the inner heart of Adam. He failed to protect, teach, correct and guide his wife the same as how God pastored him, instead he believed in wife and followed the words and actions of wife and even to be against God to eat the forbbiden fruit.&nbsp;Adam said to God &quot;The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.&quot; (Gen3:12 KJV) Adam&#39;s word was not merely an&nbsp;excuse, it also authentically exposed his inner heart: Adam considered the gift of God as God.&nbsp;Jesus passed all complicated laws and pin pointed out that highest&nbsp;of the&nbsp;laws is&nbsp;&quot; &#39;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&#39; This is the first and greatest commandment.&quot; (Mat22:37-38 NIV)&nbsp;&quot;And the second is like it: &#39;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#39; All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.&quot;&nbsp;(Mat22:39-40 NIV) More accurately speaking, Adam is the only one who committed the first not second of the top two commandments. Eating the forbidden fruit is not the&nbsp;reason&nbsp;but the result of sin. Genesis 2 shows that the creation of man was finished but not yet.&nbsp;After Adam and Eve were created and united as oneness (Gen2:24), the creation of man was&nbsp;done but not yet. Paul said, &quot;So it is written: &quot;The first man Adam became a living being&quot; ; the last Adam, a lifegiving spirit.&quot; (1Co15:45 NIV). Jesus came to the world not to judge who was fault. Any one who believe in Him will have the eternal love greater than Adam.</div>

<div p="1">In the Gospels, Jesus called God as his &#39;Father&#39;. This is not&nbsp;something new that He invented. Whom Jesus called &#39;father&#39; is identical to whom Adam called &#39;father&#39;. A goal Jesus&nbsp;came to the world is to restore the original meaning of &#39;father&#39; that Adam invented in Gen2:24 before the fall. It is through the restoration of the original meaming of &#39;father&#39;, the etymology issue of &#39;mother&#39; can be solved. &#39;mother&#39; is not Mary, nor Eve, nor&nbsp;goddees nor heavenly mother. &#39;mother&#39;&nbsp;originally intended to point to God by Adam representing the&nbsp;woman. Whereas the original meaning of &#39;mother&#39;, defined by Adam after God&#39;s judgement will remain until today&nbsp;(Gen3:20). By calling &#39;Father&#39; on the cross to forgive us, Jesus accomplished the &#39;father&#39; contextualization.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Gen 2:24 states that man should leave father and mother. If Gen2:24 came from the tongue of Moses,&nbsp;it would be subject to conflict&nbsp;the human virtue of parent filial responsibility that&nbsp;is related to the fifth of the Ten Commandments in the OT: &ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother.&rdquo; However, Gen2:24 is more consistent with Jesus&#39; teaching. When a disciple said to Jesus to first let him&nbsp;go and bury his&nbsp;father,&nbsp;Jesus told him, &quot;Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&quot;&nbsp;(Mat8:22 NIV).&nbsp;Jesus once&nbsp;said about the mother, &quot;Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.&quot;(Mat12:48-50 NIV)</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Conclusion</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Whether Gen2:24 came from the tongue of Adam or Moses (the narrator) is uncertain. Most scholars believe that Gen2:24 is from the writer. All modern Egnlish&nbsp;translations of the Bible exclude&nbsp;Gen2:24 out of Adam&#39;s quotation marks. It could be a reason for Christian community to overlook the case that Gen2:24&nbsp;were from Adam.&nbsp;The study shows that both cases do not conflict each other, instead, they support each other and can deepen and widen the knowledge of the bibical meaning of father and mother. Ambiguity of quotation could be a literature device&nbsp;enciphering or compressing the potential&nbsp;biblical information. The first occurance of the word &#39;said&#39; in Genesis 1:3, can&nbsp;infer that all words afterward, including the book of Genesis, Torah, the OT and the NT,&nbsp;are words of God (Elohim).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">
<div p="1">If Gen2:24 were&nbsp;from mouth of Adam, &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; would have to point to the Creator of Adam. It does not mean the Creator God was both father and mother with two characteristics. Instead, the different kinds of&nbsp;names of God represent different kinds of characteristics of different callers including&nbsp;man, woman,&nbsp;race,&nbsp;ethnic group and&nbsp;religious group, etc.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">The word &#39;father&#39; was originally given by Adam as a name for God. Adam represents not only the first created man (adam), but also the whole humanity, as well as the generic man (esh) contrast to womam (esha). The word &#39;mother&#39;&nbsp;given by Adam, was supposed to be used by&nbsp;Eve or woman (esha) to call God.&nbsp;However, due to&nbsp;the fall of Adam and Eve, the meaning of &#39;mother&#39; was changed from a name called by woman (esha)&nbsp;to become a name used as&nbsp;&#39;the mother of all the living&#39;, which is &#39;Eve&#39; --&nbsp;equivalent to a name of a god&nbsp;for Adam.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Gen2:24 is the most important verse in the Bible. Through the verse, it&nbsp;revealed the foundation of the complicated human relationships between generic man and proper name of man, and masculine man and woman, father and mother, as well as&nbsp;the relationship between the generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;the contitutional marriage, the mission of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;While God finished the creation of Adam and Eve, the creation of man is done but not yet.</div>

<div p="1">The original biblical meaning of &#39;man&#39; (adam) was given by God for the prototypical man, meaning &#39;the dust of ground with breath of God&#39;.&nbsp; The name &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; were given by Adam. The name &#39;man&#39; (ish) was the name of man (adam) Adam called himself. The very original biblical meaning of woman (אִשָּׁה eshah) is &#39;taken out of man (אִישׁ esh)&#39;. The original concepts of man (ish) and womam (ishah) have nothing to do with &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; nor gender or sex. In eyes of God there is no difference they are called man (adam). In eyes of Adam, man can be distinguished by man (ish) the first and woman (ishah) in second.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">(1) father and mother two individuals refer to one God.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Adam and Eve are&nbsp;the only two individuals created directly in hands of God. Adam and Eve are the first pair and the only pair created by God.</span></div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Adam knew more about God than Eve due to the creation features.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Adam&nbsp;knew of God more than every one else including Eve in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">compared with all others,&nbsp;Adam is closest to God.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Adam named many, did he name God?</span></div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Adam knew of God at least from two perspectives: &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">&#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are part of the likeness of God.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Adam knew of God from his personal feeling or experience&nbsp;and from Eve,&nbsp;the other half part of himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p="">The one unit of two individuals of Adam and Eve is the man what God created.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Each individual cannot be the full&nbsp;man that bears image and likeness of God.</div>

<div p="">Only the pair of Adam Eve with prioritization, as a whole can meet&nbsp;the likeness of God.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Gen2:7 marks&nbsp;the&nbsp;fulfilment of&nbsp;Gen1:26 - the first step of creation of man (COM). Adam represented both an individual man and the abstract species of human being.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is both a concrete individual and the abstract mankind.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Gen2:24 marks the&nbsp;the fulfilment of&nbsp;Gen1:27 - the second step of the creation of man:&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam represent&nbsp;both an individual&nbsp;&#39;male&#39; man as contrast to&nbsp;&#39;female&#39; and also the collective mankind including both male and female.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam can not fullly know of God individually.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">To know God when both Adam and Eve with&nbsp;oneness can know God&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">It is only when Adam and Eve become one flesh&nbsp;that Adam can know of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam represent the likeness of God in &#39;male&#39; style. Eve represent the likeness of God in &#39;female&#39; style.</div>

<div p="">Only when Adam and Eve become oneness, they, as one man, can be likeness of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Eve commited sin first, Adam commit sin second.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&quot;From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.&quot; (Act17:26 NIV) &#39;One man&#39; have to refer to both Adam and the oneness of Adam and Eve.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">After Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the quality of bones and flesh are toxified.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">Gen2:24 is the last word that Adam left before the fall of man.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">It is both the present tense and future tense. can be considered as a command.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">to leave father and mother, infer to leave the world of heaven to come to the world of the earth.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p=""><span style="font-size:8px;">to leave God, to commit the mission of God on earth.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">To rule over the creature moving on the earth.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">father represents the &#39;male&#39; part of the likeness of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Just like Adam represent both male and mankind including both male and female,&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">father represent both the image of God, but also the likenss of God,</div>

<div p="">father represent both the likeness of both in &#39;male&#39;&nbsp; but also the both male and female.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Adam can represent both, Eve cannot reprresent the both.</div>

<div p="">father can represent all, mother cannot represent all.&nbsp; although they are in oneness.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">There is no goddess, God have both charaters of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;, but the concept of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are not based on the concept of sex in culture, but based on God&#39;s&nbsp;plan of the redemption.</div>

<div p="">This could explain why God made covenant with Abraham through&nbsp;circumscation, which is the most shameful ritural in all cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">This could be the reason why Jesus call God as heavenly father rather than mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Jesus was the son of God, rather than the daughter of God.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">After Adam and Eve were created and united as oneness (Gen2:24), the creation of man was&nbsp;done but not yet. man&nbsp;is now in the middle of process to be fruitfu,&nbsp;to increase the number, to subdue the earth, to rule over the creatures moving on the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">
<div p="1">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcponline.org/">prayer book</a>, first published in 1549 and now in its fourth edition, is the symbol of unity for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.anglicancommunion.org/identity/about.aspx">Anglican Communion</a>. The Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion founded in 1867. While there is no clear timeline for the changes, religious leaders at the denomination&rsquo;s recent triennial conference in Austin have agreed to a demand to replace the masculine terms for God such as &ldquo;He&rdquo; and &ldquo;King&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father.&rdquo;</div>

<div p="1">Indeed, early Christian writings and texts, all refer to God in feminine terms.</div>

<div p="1">In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&amp;version=NRSV">Genesis</a>, for example, women and men are created in the &ldquo;Imago Dei,&rdquo; image of God, which suggests that God transcends socially constructed notions of gender.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Furthermore,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+32%3A18&amp;version=NRSV">Deuteronomy</a>, the fifth book of the Hebrew Bible&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195133242.001.0001/acprof-9780195133240">written in the seventh century B.C.</a>, states that God gave birth to Israel.</div>

<div p="1">In the oracles of the eighth century prophet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+42%3A14&amp;version=NRSV">Isaiah</a>, God is described as a woman in labor and a mother comforting her children.</div>

<div p="">There are two parts in this verse. The first part is about the parents. The second part is about the marriage. This verse has been directly quoted and discussed in the NT (Mat19:4-5, Mak10:6-9, Eph5:31-32, 1Co6:16-17). Even Jesus quoted this verse (Mat19:5,&nbsp; Mak10:6-9). However, all of discussion focus on the issue of &#39;marriage&#39;, the later part of the verse. The first part about the parents was rarely questioned and hence seldomly discussed directly&nbsp;in the NT (Mat8:21-22)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Two issues for the first part of the verse: (1) who said so? (2) what&nbsp;are&nbsp;the &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; meant to?</div>

<div p="">(1) Who said the words&nbsp;Gen2:24?</div>

<div p="">Because previous verse of Gen2:24 is a quotation from&nbsp;Adam (Gen2:23), also because ancient Hebrew scripture has not quot mark, so there are two possibilities for Gen2:24: (a) it&nbsp;is part of the quotation&nbsp;from&nbsp;Adam. (b) it is not part of quotation but&nbsp;from narrator (Moses).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Among total of thirty English Bible translations with&nbsp;quot mark published after 1900, all versions adopt&nbsp;(b). Literal Standard Version (https://biblehub.com/lsv/genesis/2.htm) only quots the first part of Gen2:23.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The reasons for&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">(1) Adam had no parents. He knew nothing about parents. He could not say anything about parents. (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary in 18th century)</div>

<div p="">(2) Jesus quotes these as spoken by God (Mat19:5) (Ellicott&#39;s Commentary, Benson Commentary Joseph&nbsp;<b>Benson</b>&nbsp;(1748 - 1821))</div>

<div p="">(4) prediction by Moses(Gill&#39;s Exposition of the Entire Bible John&nbsp;<em>Gill</em>&nbsp;(1697 &ndash; 1771)&nbsp;);&nbsp;<strong>the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God&nbsp;</strong>(Ellicott&#39;s Commentary)</div>

<div p="">Ellicott&#39;s Commentary for English Readers (https://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/2-24.htm): &quot;These are evidently the words of the narrator. Adam names this new product of creative power, as he had named others, but <strong>he knew nothing about young men leaving their father&rsquo;s house for the wife&rsquo;s sake.</strong> Moreover, in <strong>Matthew 19:5, our Lord quotes these words as spoken by God</strong>, and the simplest interpretation of this declaration is that <strong>the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God </strong>to give this solemn sanction to marriage, founded upon Adam&rsquo;s words. The great and primary object of this part of the narrative is to set forth marriage as a Divine ordinance. The narrator describes Adam&rsquo;s want, pictures him as examining all animal life, and studying the habits of all creatures so carefully as to be able to give them names, but as returning from his search unsatisfied. At last one is solemnly brought to him who is his counterpart, and he calls her Ishah, his feminine self, and pronounces her to be his very bone and flesh. Upon this, &ldquo;He who at the beginning made them male and female &ldquo;pronounced the Divine marriage law that man and wife are one flesh.&quot;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Benson Commentary: &quot;It appears by Matthew 19:4-5, that it was God himself who said here, a man must leave all his relations to cleave to his wife;</div>

<div p="">but whether he spake this by Moses or by Adam, is uncertain.&quot;</div>

<div>Barnes&#39; Notes on the Bible:</div>

<div>These might be the words of the first man Genesis 2:24. As he thoroughly understood the relation between himself and the woman, there is no new difficulty in conceiving him to become acquainted at the same time with the relationship of son to father and mother, which was in fact only another form of that in which the newly-formed woman stood to himself. The latter is really more intimateand permanent than the former, and naturally therefore takes its place, especially as the practical of the filial tie, - that of being trained to maturity, - is already accomplished, when the conjugal one begins.</div>

<div>But it seems more probable that this sentence is the reflection of the inspired author on the special mode in which the female was formed from the male. Such remarks of the writer are frequently introduced by the word &quot;therefore&quot; (על־כן kēn-‛al). It is designed to inculcate on the race that was to spring from them the inviolable sanctity of the conjugal relation.</div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">In the primeval wedlock one man was joined to one woman only for life. Hence, in the marriage relation the animal is subordinate to the rational. The communication of ideas; the cherishing of the true, the right, the good; the cultivation of the social affections; the spontaneous outflow of mutual good offices; the thousand nameless little thoughts, looks, words, and deeds that cheer the brow and warm the heart; the common care of children, servants, and dependents; the constant and heartfelt worship of the Father of all, constitute the main ends and joys of the married state.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">After the exclamation of the man on contemplating the woman, as bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, and therefore physically, intellectually, and morally qualified to be his mate, we may suppose immediately to follow the blessing of man, and the general endowment of himself and the animals with the fruits of the soil as recorded in the preceding chapter Genesis 1:28-30. The endowment of man embraces every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. This general grant was of course understood by man to exclude the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was excepted, if not by its specific nature, yet by the previous command given to man. This command we find was given before the formation of the woman, and therefore sometime before the events recorded in the second and third clauses of Genesis 1:27. Hence, it preceded the blessing and the endowment. It was not special, however, to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to be intended for other purposes than the food of man, as there are very many other trees that afford no proper nutriment to man. The endowment, therefore, refers to such trees as were at the same time nutritive and not expressly and previously forbidden.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:8px;">This chapter is occupied with the &quot;generations, issues or products of the skies and the land,&quot; or, in other words, of the things created in the six days. It is the meet preface to the more specific history of man, as it records his constitution, his provision, his moral and intellectual cultivation, and his social perfection. It brings us up to the close of the sixth day. As the Creator pronounced a sentence of approbation on all that he had made at the end of that day, we have reason to believe that no moral derangement had yet taken place in man&#39;s nature.</span></div>

These are the words of Moses by Divine instinct, or his inference from Adam&rsquo;s words.</div>

<div p="">Gill&#39;s Exposition of the Entire Bible<br />
Therefore shall a man leave his father, and his mother,.... These are thought by some to be the words of Moses, inferring from the above fact, what ought to be among men; and by others, the words of Adam under divine inspiration, <strong>as the father of mankind instructing his sons what to do, and foretelling what would be done in all succeeding ages: though they rather seem to be the words of God himself, by whom marriage was now instituted;</strong></div>

24. Therefore shall a man, &amp;c.] This verse contains the comment which the narrator makes upon the words of the man in Genesis 2:23. <strong>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; introduces his inference. </strong>As in Genesis 10:9, Genesis 26:33, Genesis 32:32, a sentence beginning with &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; supplies the application, or relation, of the ancient narrative to later times.</div>

<div>It is the man who is to leave &ldquo;father and mother,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the woman.&rdquo; Some compare the story in Jdg 15:1, where the woman remains with her family or clan, and Samson comes to live with her. This feature has been thought to illustrate the primitive usage of &ldquo;the matriarchate.&rdquo; But it is unlikely that the Hebrew narrative would contain a reference to such conditions.</div>

<div>Instead of &ldquo;shall leave,&rdquo; the full force of the tense in the Hebrew would be given by &ldquo;doth leave&rdquo; and &ldquo;cleaveth.&rdquo; The sanctity of marital relations is thus referred back to the very birthday of human society, being based on a principle laid down before the Fall.</div>

<div>The relation of the man to his wife is proclaimed to be closer than that to his father and mother. By the words, &ldquo;shall cleave unto his wife &hellip; one flesh,&rdquo; is asserted the sanctity of marriage. Polygamy is not definitely excluded; but the principle of monogamy seems to be implied in the words &ldquo;cleave&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall be one flesh&rdquo;: and this principle is upheld by the prophets as the ideal of marriage, in their representation of the relation of Jehovah and Israel under the metaphor of the married state.</div>

<div>Pulpit Commentary<br />
Verse 24. - Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife. There is nothing in the use of such terms as father and mother, or in the fact that the sentiment is prophetic, to prevent the words from being regarded as a continuation of Adam&#39;s speech, although, on the other hand, the statement of Christ (Matthew 19:5) <strong>does not preclude the possibility of Moses being their author; but whether uttered by the first husband (Delitzsch, Macdonald) or by the historian (Calvin, Murphy), they must be viewed as an inspired declaration of the law of marriage. Its basis (fundamental reason and predisposing cause) they affirm to be</strong></div>

<div>(1) the original relationship of man and woman, on the platform of creation; and</div>

<div>(2) the marriage union effected between the first pair. Its nature they explain to be</div>

<div>(1) a forsaking (on the part of the woman as well as the man) of father and mother - not filially, in respect of duty, but locally, in respect of habitation, and comparatively, in respect of affection; and</div>

<div p="1">The main similarities between the two creation accounts are they both state that humans are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). They also show that God created a perfect world, &quot;God saw that everything he had made, it was very good&quot; (Genesis 1:31). In both accounts, it shows that God is the creator of everything, &quot;in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1) &quot;the Lord God made the earth and the heavens&quot; (Genesis 2:4).</div>

<div p="1">The main differences between the two accounts are Genesis 1 focuses on the creation of the earth but Genesis 2 focuses on the creation of human beings. Genesis 1 is more formal as it is structured in paragraphs according to each day whereas Genesis 2 is more personal, &quot;every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat&quot; (Genesis 2:16). Another difference is the order of creation, in Genesis 1, animals were created first (Genesis 1:20-25). However, in Genesis 2, the creation of man is mentioned before the creation of animal life.&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">The image of God has no gender. Regarding the duties assigned to man, gender or sex is not necessary at all.</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">God is faithful God. (Duet 7:9) &quot;I will not alter the word that went forth from my lips&quot; (Psa 89:34) &quot;As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.&quot;(Isaiah 55:10-11)</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="">Based on what God said after He created man, it can be seen that the primary purpose to create male and female is to &quot;Be fruitfule and increase in number; fill the earth&quot; (Gen 1:28) Today human beings think that being fruitful and increasing in number is related to gender and sex. However, in the eyes of God, man are genderless or sex-free. God never said that Adam(אָדָם) is male and Eve (חַוָּה) is female. God called Eve as woman (אִשָּׁה). The word woman (אִשָּׁה) comes from the primitive root word man (אִישׁ), which means &quot;part of man.&quot; Eve is originally called woman. The name of Eve was given by Adam after the fall of man. The word man and woman, the male and female are two pairs of words. But man and male, woman and female are not connected in Hebrew until the circumcision appears (Gen 17:10)</div>

<div p="">The absence of sex in the Hebrew context indicated that the male and female are not determined by sex or gender. The purpose to create male and female is not to create two kinds of human beings based on the gender or sex. In the eyes of God, males and females are one humankind. The distinction between the male and female is the seal of God set on humankind to prepare for human beings to be able to distinguish between son and daughter, the savior and saviee.</div>

<div p="">From this perspective, it can be seen that, what God said to man (Gen 1:28) is exactly the same as what Jesus said to His disciples.(Mat 28:19-20) (a) &quot;God bless them (man)&quot; refers to &quot;Surely I(Jesus) will be with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot; (b) &quot;be fruitful&quot; means &quot;make disciples&quot;, (c) &quot;increase in number and fill the earth&quot; means &quot;throughout all nations and baptizing (fill) them in name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot;, (d) &quot;subdue and rule over&quot; means &quot;teach them to obey everything I (Jesus) have commanded you.&quot; Jesus&#39; Great Commission is not something new but the command of God when man was created in the beginning. The distinction between male and female is the distinction between son and daughter, the Son and man, the disciples and the Gentiles. In the eyes of God, human beings have only two kinds: Christian and non-Christian, like sheep and goat (Mat 25:32)</div>

<div p="1">In a word, male and female are not the trouble makers leading to adultery or pain; instead, God created male and female to prepare for the Son of God to fulfill the salvation plan.</div>
