<div>I am thinking about working on the study of initial appearance of immediate family<strong>&nbsp;</strong>vocabulary (&#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;, &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39;, &#39;husband&#39; and &#39;wife&#39;, &#39;son&#39; and &#39;daughter&#39;, &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39;, &#39;brother&#39; and &#39;sister&#39;) in Hebrew context of Genesis 1-5, because I want to find out the very original meaning of &#39;son&#39; through the earliest usage among the earliest kinship relationship during the God&#39;s creation or right after the fall, so that I can better understand the sonship of Jesus Christ (the Son of Man and the Son of God) without pre-occupied knowledge about the &#39;son&#39; from human culture.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<table>
	<tbody>

			<td>An interesting topic but be aware that it could be very broad. A study of the meaning of &quot;son&quot; could be very involved throughout the Bible. But you should be able to do a good study of &quot;son&quot; in Genesis 1-5 and draw out meanings from that study. You may need to refer to New Testament passages that comment on the genealogies and statements in Genesis 1-5 since the N.T. gives inspired commentary and interpretations. Good start. Keep studying and focusing on your topic and goal.</td>

<p>Hi Wei,</p>

<p>This proposed topic is very interesting, but I am not sure it will work (or, at least, I do not think that it will achieve what you hope it will).</p>

<p>How do you plan to pursue this topic without &quot;preoccupied knowledge about &#39;the son&#39; from human culture?&quot; By human culture, do you mean your own, ancient Near Eastern culture, and/or Second Temple period culture?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of studying kinship language aside from the use of &#39;sonship&#39; if your goal is to understand a &#39;sonship&#39; relationship?</p>

<p>How do you think Genesis 1-5 can inform the phrase &#39;Son of Man&#39; when this phrase does not appear and, if you argue that the concept behind the phrase is present, how do you reconcile 2TP understandings of this phrase that would have been in the NT&#39;s authors&#39; minds (and if not theirs, then their audiences&#39;)?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think you can go in two directions. If your goal is to understand Genesis&#39; use of familial language with the intent of understanding the structure of the family after creation and in the immediate aftermath of the fall, then your study of these familial terms would work (and this would be an amazing topic, by the way).</p>

<p>If your goal is to understand the meaning of the phrases &#39;Son of Man&#39; and &#39;Son of God,&#39; then I do not think you are going to get anywhere studying these terms in Genesis 1-5. The primary issues are that these phrases do not appear in Genesis 1-5 and that human culture significantly impacts all the language of the Bible. Whenever God communicates, he communicates in that culture&#39;s &#39;cultural river&#39; (this phrase is one used by John H. Walton). As such, if your goal is to understand the phrases &#39;Son of Man&#39; and &#39;Son of God,&#39; then you need to delve within the culture that provided those terms to see what these terms communicated in that culture. This would mean studying Ezekiel and Daniel (and their accompanying Babylon backgrounds) and 1 Enoch and other Second Temple period literature (and how these phrases develop in this corpus in light of the previous biblical backgrounds).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could take aspects of both of these and make a great topic, just not in the way you formulated it.</p>

<p>If you are set on studying Genesis and Jesus, then I would recommend studying how ancient Near Eastern peoples understood the concept of divine sonship and how the biblical authors took this cultural concept and applied it to Adam. As notions of divine sonship continued into the Roman era (cf. the emperor), you could then look at the cultural concept of divine sonship in the Greco-Roman era and see how the NT applies it to Jesus, while at the same time casting Adam and Jesus as a type and antitype since Adam was still understood in divine sonship terms (though in a different cultural context, so you would still need to trace the development of this idea across 2TP literature).</p>

<p>Here are some resources that can guide you in your thinking about culture:</p>

<p>For ANE: Walton, John H.&nbsp;<em>Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible</em>. 2d ed. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2018.</p>

<p>For 2TP: Green, Joel B., and Lee Martin McDonald (eds.).&nbsp;<em>The World of the New Testament: Cultural, Social, and Historical Contexts</em>. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2017.</p>

<p>If you decide that any of the topics I provided above would be a good topic to pursue, let me know and I can send some other resources your way. I would encourage you to reach out to Dr. Noonan (Old Testament) or Dr. Naylor (New Testament) for some guidance on these topics. They have both spent quite a bit of time in this area. I hope that all of this has been helpful and I look forward to seeing where you take this idea!</p>

<p>Blessings,</p>

<p>Brandon</p>

<p>Brandom, Thank you for your great points. I realized that I need to narrow it down. I will focus on the earliest full familial Hebrew vocabulary during the creation and immediate aftermath of the fall in Genesis1-5. Depending on the results of the characteristics of &#39;son&#39; found in Genesis, I will deduct the connection between the &#39;son&#39; in Genesis and the sonship of Jesus. In this way, the discussion will bypass or at least minimize&nbsp;the biological concept of &#39;son&#39; pre-occupied by the cultural knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>

<p>I like your topic. It will be interesting to read what you learn about the family vocabulary found in the early, foundational chapters of Genesis. Will your research focus on specific Hebrew words in Genesis 1-5 or is it more of a cultural/historical study of the familial concepts found in the &ldquo;Hebrew context of Genesis 1-5&rdquo;? <strong>Will you make any application regarding how Christ&rsquo;s sonship (the Son of Man and the Son of God) relates to believers&rsquo; adoption as sons?</strong> I look forward to reading more about what you learn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Your&nbsp;comments are fantastic. Indeed, what you pointed out is what I am struggling&nbsp;for. Sometimes, I doubt if I can articulate it theologically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;How do you plan to pursue this topic without &quot;preoccupied knowledge about &#39;the son&#39; from human culture?&quot;</p>

<p>(a) This paper will follow the theological axiom: The 66 books of the Bible&nbsp;is the Word of God. God is the real author of the Bible. The so-called authors of each book in&nbsp;the Bible are indeed the scribers purely inspired by the Spirit of God. From hamartiological perspective, scribers and readers are identical in that they all are sinners, and they share the equal right and capability&nbsp;to pursue to understand the meaning of the Scripture. With such faith, each word of God&nbsp;and&nbsp;even a notation mark is&nbsp;important and precious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(b) Genesis is the only book in the Bible particularly describing&nbsp;about the origin of the world. It is&nbsp;a book not only about the creation of the physical material world and biological living things including mankind, about the origin of the sin and origin of human civilization, but also&nbsp;about the motivation of creation including&nbsp;the will of God, the love of God, the mission of God, the plan of God, the ultimate goal of God, as well as the characters of the triunion&nbsp;God Himself. Genesis can be considered as a highly compressed version of the Bible that could&nbsp;be&nbsp;progressively revealed by His people and that had&nbsp;been fulfilled by Jesus Christ. Genesis is both the beginning and the end of the Bible.&nbsp;Any biblical issue can be traced back to Genesis.</p>

<p>Due to the abandency and complexity, Genesis has to be viewed from various perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(c) Genesis 1:3-31 demonstrates that God&#39;s creation is not a randomly big bang but has a strict sequential order with beginning and&nbsp;end. Every detail has its divine purpose. Any order is not reverable. The Hebrew Scripture is like a chain of vocabulary&nbsp;connected by consective&nbsp; &#39;then&#39; (). The change of order is like change of DNA of&nbsp;genes, or like change of notes in the music sheet. Jesus said that the heaven and earth will be forsaked, whereas the notation of the Law will not forsaked. The order contains rich information about the will of God. The order of God is the law of God. It can be veiwed from at least two perspectives: macro order ad micro order.</p>

<p>The macro order means the order of the books in the Bible.&nbsp;Genesis is about the beginning of the world, as the first book,&nbsp;Genesis&nbsp;can be also&nbsp;considered&nbsp;as the beginning of the Scripture, the beginning of the Word of God, the beginning of the biblical vocabulary, lexicon or linguistics, the beginning of the Christianity&nbsp;faith. Without Genesis,&nbsp;without Christian faith and Christian language. The macro order underlines&nbsp;any biblical issue can be traced back to Genesis (b).</p>

<p>The micro order means the verses or vocabulary of order in the Bible.&nbsp;The sequential order of the new created things are paralell to and synchronized with the order of the appearance of the new vocabulary in the Scripture. Within the context of the Genesis, each new word and its associated&nbsp;meaning is indivisible part of the creation of God.&nbsp;It is the concepts of all vocabulary in Genesis that setup&nbsp;the foundation for all other books. No new vocabulary outside of the Genesis can&nbsp;be as important as it is&nbsp;in context of creation period.&nbsp; To study the original meaning of any word in the Bible should start with its initial usage in the Bible. (This study method&nbsp;can be called the biblical etymology.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Althought the meaning of the word can be twistted in culture to become the element&nbsp;of pre-occupied human knowledge, the meaning of the first appearance of new vocabulary remains to be closest to&nbsp;what&nbsp;God meant. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis was widely consensed to be written in Hebrew around 1500 BC far later after the God&#39;s creation,&nbsp;the&nbsp;delay cannot deny the perpectual truth of the God&#39;s creation which is consolidated by Jesus Christ on the cross.&nbsp; When reading the Genesis from the beginning, unless being&nbsp;reborned, seldom could notice an intensified&nbsp;struggle between understanding the creation from a cultural view and&nbsp;understanding the culture from the Creator&#39;s view.&nbsp;Such struggle could fade out quickly, especially after the fall,&nbsp;in a way&nbsp;of&nbsp;shifting&nbsp;from the Creator&#39;s view to a cultural view of the pre-occupied human knowedge.</p>

<p>Although Adam is less likely&nbsp;to be able to&nbsp;understand the Hebrew Genesis, he&nbsp;could testify the authenticity of the story of the God&#39;s creation, since he&nbsp;experienced part of the God&#39;s creation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another word, there is a version of Genesis before&nbsp;the creation. This version of Genesis is readable for Adam and Abraham. that already exist before the Hebrew Genesis,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the characteristic of Genesis that differs from all other books is that from the beginning, it contains&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understanding&nbsp;the culture in the Creator&#39;s view or understanding the creation from a cultural view. Genesis progressively shift from the view of Creator to the view in&nbsp;the culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reading Genesis always exists a significant struggle of understanding the world between the Creator&#39;s view and preoccupied knowledge from human culture&nbsp;</p>

<p>due to the limitation of the created human beings, Genesis has to record the creation story from many different perspectives. Many&nbsp;scholars believe the creationism against the evolutionary theory&nbsp;</p>
