<div>===========================</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>1. Study Background.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Patristic era (the first 5&nbsp;centuries):&nbsp;the debate focus on Trinity. (Father, Son, Spirit)</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Middle Age: the Son of God.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Reforrmation: the son of God, the Son of Man, the hypostatic union of Jesus (incarnation).</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Results :</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a) trinity: doctrine accepted;</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) the dichotomy is accepted become doctrine.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Another possible similarity&nbsp;<a href="https://israelbiblecenter.com/courses/biblical-hebrew-first-steps/" target="_blank">between quantum physics and the Hebrew Bible relates to the four-letter name of God &ndash; יהוה (<em>YHWH</em>)</a>. People have wondered about and argued over this name for many centuries. A great number of different theories try to define its proper pronunciation and original meaning.&nbsp;<strong>One of the most popular ideas is that the Hebrew Bible&rsquo;s name for God is a verb that expresses past, present, and future tenses all at once!</strong>&nbsp;According to this interpretation, the name&nbsp;<em>YHWH</em>&nbsp;means something like &ldquo;the one who was-is-will be.&rdquo; This is a very old idea that may go back as far as the&nbsp;<a href="https://israelbiblecenter.com/roundtable-talks/jewish-greek-septuagint/" target="_blank">Jewish-Greek Septuagint translation (ca. 200 BCE/BC)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://israelbiblecenter.com/courses/revelation-jewish-context-i-orientation/" target="_blank">Book of Revelation (1st century AD/CE)</a>.</div>

<div><strong>If we were to translate this understanding of God&rsquo;s name into the language of quantum physics, we might call it &ldquo;a superposition of all possible states.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;Indeed, quantum mechanics posits that the particles or waves that apparently make up our universe (and us) can exist in all possible states at once &ndash; until someone carries out a &ldquo;measurement.&rdquo; Once you measure the location of a particle, it &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; to a single specific location. Perhaps the name of God,&nbsp;<em>YHWH</em>, is similar: it communicates Being in all states, dimensions, and times simultaneously &ndash; and if you try to define the meaning more specifically, you end up reducing it to just one aspect.</div>

<div>2. Current Issue of Trinity:</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;a) Dictum: an incontrovertible and irreducible, indisputable and&nbsp;uncompromising&nbsp;dictum,&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;b) Dogma: tool to distinguish herecy but&nbsp;gradually&nbsp;a&nbsp;bully label and dictatorship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;c) miss the specialized professional study about son:</div>

<div>3.&nbsp; About Huiosology</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) In western: The term &#39;son of god&#39; in Roman already exist before Christ but no huiosology.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) In China: the emporor is called the &#39;son of heaven&#39;. Only China has a catagory in study speically&nbsp;on&nbsp;sonship (zi) but no connection to Jesus. The theory about character of zi are included in&nbsp;Confucious (KongZi) about how to be a man, MenZi about the rightieousness,&nbsp;&nbsp;Daoism (LaoZi) about soft power, humility, including water-like character:&nbsp;invisible and the lowest&nbsp;but powerful.&nbsp; All of these are similar to characters of Jesus. All of these are manipulated for personal surviving, protection and ultimately the&nbsp;dictatorship rulling of others. The well-known ccp motto &#39;Serve the People Heart and Soul&#39; is an example -- to be your servant in order to rule over you --&nbsp;invisible, meek, friendly and humble but powerful (called soft power today in China) -- the essense of Chinese characterized socialism, totalitarianism, or autocracy and the essence of the beautiful Chinese culture and wisdom.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>4. OOM<br />
OOP practice successfully demonstrated&nbsp;the parents-children relationship and the abstraction and instance relationship. It is a good worldview to deal with &quot;according to its kinds&quot;&nbsp;OOP is not only a practical programming technique,&nbsp;a method&nbsp;of product design and analysis, but also a methodology,&nbsp;a philosophy and a worldview about how&nbsp;the world is organically structured. It could be a way to better understand how&nbsp;God created the world and man,&nbsp;and hence it could help to better understand the biblical meaning of son, and the Son of God and the Son of Man. OOM could be a scientific foundation for huiosology in theology study.</div>

<div>&nbsp; a) class vs object</div>

<div>&nbsp; b) run time vs design-time.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; c) inheritance vs heritage.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>5. Biblical Meaning of Son.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>a) Creation Theology: three layers theory and three steps theory.</div>

<div>b) Image vs likeness</div>

<div>c) Male and Female</div>

<div>d) Father and mother</div>

<div>e) Son and daughter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>6.&nbsp;Huiosological Summary</div>

<div>a) the biblical meaning of &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39; are the religious words has nothing to do with gender and sex. &#39;Male&#39; is related to the covenant, &#39;Female&#39; is related the cleansing.</div>

<div>b)&nbsp; the biblial meaniing of &#39;man&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; is creation purpose based. has nothing to do with gender and sex.</div>

<div>c) &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39; are the originally the name used by Adam to call God to represent the creation characteristics for the Adam and Eve. &#39;</div>

<div>d) &#39;son&#39; and &#39;daughter&#39; originally has no direct connections. Son is first used when&nbsp;Enoch is the son of the criminal&nbsp;Cain(Gen 4:17). Seth is the son &#39;in replace of&#39; the killed person Abel(Gen 4:25). daughter is seldomly used as compared with &#39;son&#39;&nbsp;</div>
