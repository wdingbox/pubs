      <p>Everyone knows the meaning of the word "son". But for its literally equivalent word Zi (子) in Chinese language, both of its usage and meaning, are still an unresolved mystery in its ancient history. For, example, why Zi (子) is commonly used in ancient books and the sage's name, like, KongZi 孔子 (Confucius), MenZi 孟子 (Mencius), LaoZi 老子 (Laoism/Daoism), etc. This paper applied the word frequency-spectrum analysis along with the category-periodic comparison method to study the roles and characteristics of the word Zi in Chinese ancient documents. The research found that the rank and the density of Zi (子) in some specific categories of ancient books appears "unreasonably" high in time of BC. But it sharply went down and remained stable in time of AD. The discovery, that the similarity of the meaning of the high frequent prefix and suffix of Zi (子) during its high frequency period is very similar to the words that is used to describe the Messiah both in the OT and the NT, provides an important clue that could lead to the possible sonship contextualization -- the original meaning of "son" (Zi 子) in ancient China is likely to point to the first advent of the Son of God--Jesus Christ. While struggling about the connection between the East and the West, this study also can trigger Christians, missionaries and theologians today to further rethink the contextualizational meaning of the "son" in our daily life -- why Jesus Christ is described as the Son of man and the Son of God.</p>
      <p>similarity of the complexity of sonship between the pre-China and the Bible.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Key Words: son, Zi (子), contextualization, inter-culture, Chinese pre-Qin documents.&nbsp;</p>

    <div>
      <a>Three major tasks were completed in this research: A) to carefully select certain amount of Chinese documents; B) to classify the collected documents; C) to compute the frequency-spectrum and to generate the category-periodic table.&nbsp;</a>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <h4>Document Collection</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Document collection is a process to select all pre-Qin documents as well as other documents&nbsp; that are either related or helpful in the research. Following factors are considered during the documents collection process.</p>
            <ol type="A">
              <li>
                <a>The pre-Qin documents:</a>
                <p>The term pre-Qin is also called pre-China. The word "China" is a western name given for "Qin". According to the history study, Qin is the first dynasty (221-206 BC) in history that unified all states into one nation. Hence, the term pre-Qin literally refers to the period of history before 221 BC. However, before around seventh century BC, there is no bamboo-strips, or any paper-like lengthy document -- all the archeologists can find are just pieces or groups of characters on bronzes or bones. Therefore, the term pre-Qin of documents actually refers to a narrow period of time between the seventh century BC and the second century BC, which is also called the Spring-Autumn and Warring States (770-221 BC).</p>
                <p>The term pre-Qin first appears in the book of HanShu in the first century AD. The reason that the term is widely accepted and used in history is probably not because of the unification of the warring states, but because of a key factor that all sages and significant philosophical documents only appeared during a short time period before 221 BC. After that, for more than two thousand of years, there is no any one or document that can compare with them.</p>
                <p>In theory, the pre-Qin documents are the foundation of the Chinese culture. All basic concepts and terms about the moral, politics, life, worldview and faith, etc. come from the pre-Qin document. The pre-Qin documents are the bases of all other documents and influencing people even until today. It is the pre-Qin documents that cultivate the people's spiritual mind that can distinguish themselves to others in the world. From the missiological view point, the pre-Qin documents is a stronghold for the missionary of China. The pre-Qin documents are the primary target in this research.</p>
                <p>In practice, the term of pre-Qin documents is hard to follow, since there is no consensus agreement on the book list for the pre-Qin documents in history.&nbsp; The pre-Qin documents is actually a concept of fuzzy set. This paper primarily follows the list of Chinese Text Project and considers about fifty of those with the label of year before 221 BC as pre-Qin documents.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a>The post-Qin documents:</a>
                <p>There is no such term of post-Qin in Chinese history. The term of the post-Qin used here is to contrast the pre-Qin documents, which refers to the documents written after 221 BC until today. To extract the features of the pre-Qin documents, the post-Qin documents has to be studied together. The pre-Qin documents are limited, but the post-Qin documents are almost unlimited in quantity. This research only selected about hundred of post-Qin documents to balance between the pre-Qin and post-Qin, the important and unimportant, philosophical and non-philosophical documents. This paper collected about a hundred of documents that mainly from the Chinese Text Project (ctext.org).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a>The biblical and non-biblical Chinese documents:</a>
                <p>The biblical documents refers to various translated Chinese versions of the Bible. The non-biblical document refers to the other translated Chinese documents including Quran, Mormon and other western works. The purpose to choose variety of documents is to facilitate the features extraction for the Chinese character Zi in pre-Qin documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In a summary, a total of about 150 documents are selected for the research, which covers about 50 pre-Qin documents, and various other documents in different disciplines and different times, including the translated western works. The purpose to choose variety of documents is to facilitate the features extraction for the Chinese character Zi in pre-Qin documents.&nbsp; A brief review of the collected documents can be seen in <a title="#Table-1">Table-1.&nbsp;</a></p>

          <h4>Document Classification</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Document classification is a process to assign a document to a specific group or class that that shares some common feature. Two types of classification method are used in the research: the time-based and the content-based classification.</p>
            <ol type="A">
              <li>
                <a>Time Series Classification:</a>
                <p>Time series classification in this paper is to deal with classifying the existing documents over the written date to extract the information of the documents through the time serious quantity data, like the word frequency. The most challenging work in time series classification in this research is that the written dates of the existing&nbsp;Chinese documents cannot be accurate enough into a year. Moreover, many documents do not have reliable writing information but are full of puzzles. To better fit such situation, this paper proposed a dual time series classification method--one is the simplified Chinese traditional dynasty series classification,&nbsp; the other is the Christian era classification method.&nbsp;</p>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    <a>The Simplified Chinese Dynasty Series Classification:</a>
                    <p>The simplified Chinese dynasty series classification method comes from the traditional Chinese dynasty series classification method that is to classify the ancient documents according to the dynasty associated with in history. Pre-Qin can be considered as a most popular and successful dynasty classification used in Chinese history. The traditional method has encountered many issues for today. First, a dynasty could be long or short. For example, a book of Han Dynasty could be written in any time between 206 BC and 220 AD.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Second, there are about two dozens of dynasties in history. Some of them may overlap. As the Gregorian system became more and more popular after twentieth century in China, the traditional dynasty-based classification seemed to be more and more awkward.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Third, dynasty classification is a personal dictatorship based chronicle method. It helps to remember the rulers name but does not reflect the features of its society.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This paper introduced the western pre-modern and post-modern concepts into the traditional dynasty classification, and proposed a simplified four-period of dynasty series classification model: PreQin (before 221 BC), QinHan (221 BC - 220 AD), pre-modern (220-1911 AD) and post-modern (1911--).&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In the West, pre-modern is the period in society which came prior to Modernity. Modern society began in Europe after the introduction of Industrial society and large-scale production. There is no concreate date for division. Some scholars prefer to apply the date of 1698, when the first steam engine was invented by James Watt (1736-1819),&nbsp; as the end of the pre-modern or the beginning of the post-modern.</p>
                    <p>In China, many scholars refers the pre-modern to the time before the end of Great Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). From the perspective of the document research, several reasons support this. 1)&nbsp; After 1911, the Chinese vernacularization began to spread. It is the first time in history that the people began to seek the identical solution between the oral language and writing language. 2) The first full version of the Chinese Bible, which is in the Chinese vernacular language, also called Chinese union version, was published in 1919. Chinese documents had significant difference after 1911. This can be seen in the research in this paper.&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a>The Christian Era Classification:</a>
                    <p>The Christian era, also called the common era, is the period of time which begins with the traditional date of Christ's birth. It is also called AD (from Latin anno Domini, after the Lord of Jesus Christ). The period before AD is called BC (abbreviated from Before Christ).&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>The Christian era classification and the Chinese pre-Qin classification are more or less similar in that both have one specific epoch time. The significance of the preQin in China is similar to the AD in the West. From a bird view of the history of the world, 221 BC and 1AD are close enough with the human deviation. The differences is that the preQin emphasizes the period before 221 BC, the AD emphasizes the period after 1 AD.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>However, due to the defects of the Chinese documents, the preQin classification method cannot be actually applied into its document categorization. Many documents considered to be written after Qin (221BC) are similar and closely related to the preQin documents. Hence, when studying the preQin documents, some scholars also include documents written in the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), and they call them the documents of&nbsp;preQin and Han. A typical example can be seen in Chinese Text Project (ctext.org), organized and maintained by Dr. Donald Sturgeon. This method expands the pre-Qin document date range for about 400 years from the year before 221 BC to 220 AD.&nbsp; Noticing that the middle point between 221 BC and 220 AD is the common era, while maintain the Chinese traditional dynasty classification method, this paper also applied the Christian era classification in the research with&nbsp;plus and minus 200 years as the deviation.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>In summary, two time-based classification methods are applied in the research at the same time: the simplified dynasty-series classification and the Christian era classification. These two types of classification represent not only the difference in periodic time, but also in the cultures between the eastern and the western.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Due to the defects of the pre-Qin documents that the written date is full of uncertainty, it would be too narrow to study the documents written before 221 BC, and it would be too broad for those written before 220 AD. As comparison, Christian ara classification with date before 1AD can better reflect the nature of the date for pre-Qin documents study. This paper combined the two methods into one for research. For the selected book count and word count in different period, see&nbsp;<a title="#Table-2">Table-2</a>,&nbsp;<a title="#Table-3">Table-3</a>.<br></p>
              </li>
              <li>Document Categorization:<br>
                <p>Document Categorization is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories.&nbsp;Two basic methods are popular in Chinese documents: family-based and the content-based classification.</p>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    <a>Family-Based Classification.</a>
                    <p>Family-based classification is to assign a document to a specific family. The family, also called the school, is a group of people who share some common views. Each family usually has a founder that people could follows. Hence, the family based classification is a people-oriented classification method. For example, KongZi (Confucius) and MenZi (Mencius) are consistent in teaching, so they are classified into Ru family or school, KongZi is considered as the founder of Ru family; LaoZi and ZhuangZi are similar, they are gropped to a family of Dao. LaoZi is considered as the founder of the Dao family.</p>
                    <p>Family-based classification is the Chinese traditional and oldest classification method in China. It can be found in pre-Qin documents. For example, book of&nbsp;荀子 XunZi contains criticism about the&nbsp;plagiarism in Ru family. But how and why the family-based classification started is still unknown. But the only thing that is known is that the family-based people-oriented classification is an important feature of the pre-Qin culture. For over two thousand following years, almost no new family or school ever appeared in history until now.</p>
                    <p>A critical issue in people-oriented classification is that the definition of the school or family cannot be clearly defined. For example, today, the term Ru family is usually defined as a system of philosophical and ethical teachings or thoughts founded by KongZi and his followers. But what the&nbsp; Ru family exactly teaches about is still arguable and uncertain. Even the meaning of character Ru is not clear. Run cannot be found in the bronzes or oracle bones. The first Chinese dictionary (Shuowen jiezi 說文解字), being dated back to first century AD, says, <q>Ru means gentle and is how men of techniques are called</q>(儒, 柔也术士之称) The scholar Liang Cai pointed out that “KongZi (Confucius) did not create Ru-family (Confucianism). Actually, no one ever thought so.” Liang Cai pointed out that it is a puzzle in history that people were turned away to focus on the study of the Ru family (or Confucianism).<br></p>
                    <p>In spite of the defect of the people-oriented classification, there is no better way to well organized the pre-Qin document so far. How to biblically classify the pre-Qin documents will be a challenging work that missionaries need to do in future. At the moment, this paper will follow the existing people-oriented classification.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <a>Content-based Classification:</a>
                    <p>Content-based classification is to assign a document to a specific subject, topic or an area of discipline according to its content.&nbsp; For example, the history, medicine, military etc. The content-based classification is object-oriented method, it is more explicit and less arguable than the family based classification.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>This paper will combine the traditional family-cased and content-based classification methods, and call them as a category.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In summary, with the time series classification and the content or family based categorization, a category-periodic table can be created for analysis. It is through such platform that the features of the word can be extracted and exposed to readers.</p>
            <p><span>For example,&nbsp;</span>the number of the books with its title or name that contain Zi, is shown in <a title="#Table-4">Table-4</a>. From the table, it can be found that the number of the books in the Ru family in preQin period are much more than other. In order to make it comparable with others, the rate of the book with Zi is used. The result can be seen in <a title="#Table-5">Table-5</a></p>

          <h4>Frequency-Spectrum Computation</h4>
          <p>Based on the collected documents and its classification, a small software program is made so that it can generate:</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>
              <a>Frequency</a>
              <p>In this research, the term frequency refers to the repeated occurrence of a word or character over a specific document or a particular category of documents. The frequency value could be an integer number of the repeated occurrence, or a ratio of the number of the occurrence&nbsp;to the given size of its document. The ratio could be in form of percent (pc) or in form of per million (pm).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Spectrum:<br>
              <br>
              In this paper, the term spectrum refers to a series of quantity data listed in a sorted&nbsp; sequence. The data to be listed could be the frequency or the rank of the frequency of the word. The rank number is zero-base number with lower number the higher in rank.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a>Frequency-Spectrum:</a>
              <p>Frequency-spectrum is a graphical display of data with vertical height representing the frequency value of the data and the horizontal index representing the spectrum of the listed data.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Summery</h4><a>About 150 documents are selected in the research; about 50 of them are considered as pre-Qin documents.</a>

  <h3>IV. Features Extraction and Analysis</h3>
  <section>
    <h4>Features Extraction</h4><a>In this paper, features extraction means to abstract the meanings from the results of the computated large amount of documents and texts and to identify the useful information or features that can distinguish itself from others. This process includes the visual analysis of the outpu image, like the frequency-spectrum graphics.</a>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>There is only one document among about 150 of collections that does not contain the word Zi. The name of the book is HaiDaoSuanJing that belongs&nbsp;to the category of mathematic.&nbsp;It makes sense that this book does not have Zi.&nbsp;Since the book has nothing to do with "son", and its length is relatively short.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not seem to make sense&nbsp; that&nbsp; all other documents that does not among various types of documents, 99.3% of the books have the word Zi&nbsp; (son). The broad usage of Zi in various books is a feature for the character of Zi.<br>
        <br>
        The frequency-spectrum of this book can be seen in Figure-3. For simplification, this documents will be excluded in further frequency-spectrum analysis.&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are two documents to show that the frequency of Zi is "unreasonably" high and ranked on the top among the distinct words: the book of LunYu and SanZiJing. Both of them belong to Ru family. The book of LunYu is an important book in Ru family, which is about the moral, politics and philosophy, etc. SanZiJing is an rythme teaching book for students. For frequency-spectrum see&nbsp;<a title="#Figure-1">Figure-1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="#Figure-2">Figure-2.</a>&nbsp;</p>
        <div>
          For other documents, the top ranked characters are:&nbsp;之 x97, 也&nbsp; x12, 的&nbsp; x8, 不&nbsp; x7, 了&nbsp; x4, 曰&nbsp; x3, 者&nbsp; x3, 十&nbsp; x2, 有&nbsp; x2, 于&nbsp; x1, 从&nbsp; x1, 以&nbsp; x1, 兮&nbsp; x1, 其&nbsp; x1, 年&nbsp; x1, 惟&nbsp; x1, 水&nbsp; x1, 道&nbsp; x1,&nbsp; 阴&nbsp; x1.&nbsp;韵 x1. All of these are grammatical words except 水&nbsp; x1, means "water", is consistent to the content of the book of ShuiJingZhu 水经注 about rivers.&nbsp; and 曰&nbsp; x3, 道&nbsp; x1, means speak, widely used in fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By survey of all frequency-spectrum, it is found that there are about 50 documents, one third of the selected, the rank of Zi is in top 10. About 80 documents, about half of the collection, the rank of Zi is in top 20. Figure-4 shows a spectrum of the rank of Zi in the collection of the documents. This figure is consistent to the frequency of Zi in the spectrum over the selected documents. (See Figure-5). These two figures show that the frequency of character Zi is relatively stable between the lowest and highest.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A categorized frequency-spectrum (Figure-6) shows that Ru family (in red color) have higher frequency usage of Zi than others. The second one is the historical books. The similarity of the frequency-spectrum of Zi between Ru and historical books, show that they they have something in common about the character Zi -- the core value of china is Ru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The changes of the frequency-spectrum according to the simplified Chinese dynasty based periodic classification can be seen in Figure-7. The figure shows that the usage of Zi experienced two dramatic drop, one in QinHan, and on is in post-Modern. From the view of the common era, there existing a sharp drop between BC and AD. (see Figure-8) as compared with other characters changes in history, for example Zhi in Figure-9 and Figure-10.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The top 20 hightest frequency words immediately used after word Zi are listed below ccording to the periodic of common era :</p>
        <div>
          BC: 曰之不以也为胥墨贡对产者孙而路有谓何使言<br>
          AD: 曰之善不孙也言为牙所以等者吼云有名路是一<br>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div>
          It can be found from the list that there is no significant differences in usage between BC and AD. A common meaningful word follows Zi is Yue 曰, which means speak, talk, say and utter. It can be concluded that Zi is frequently infered as a speaker/talker.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>The top 20 hightest frequency words immediately used after word Zi are listed below ccording to the periodic of common era :</span></p>
        <p>BC: 君天孔公太夫晏墨之其王楚文管孟二吾弟父宣<br>
        AD:男弟天太师利种童君孔佛王儿妻之孟其夫庄老</p>
        <p>It can be found that the characters of the list of spectrum in BC can be classified into three categories as following:</p>
        <ol type="A">
          <li>
            <a>君天公太夫王弟父</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>孔晏墨楚文管孟宣</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>之其二吾</a>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The group (C) is a set of grammatical words with no meaning. The group (B) is a list of people's name, including Kong (Confucius), Mo (Moist), Men (Mencius), etc.&nbsp;</p>
        <div>
          The group (A) is a set of words that will be critical for analyzing. Hence, they are listed and translated as following. The first seven characters have mutual close relationship in documents. It's common that they appear in pair. For example, 君王, 天王, 天父, etc. This paper will give them a term called the seven wonderful words.<br>
        </div>
        <p>(1) 君 = prince, ruler<br>

        (3) 公 = catholic, public, justice<br>
        (4) 太 = super, extreme, eternal, highest<br>

        <p>As a comparison of the characters of the list between BC with AD, it's not hard to find that in the list of AD, 弟 is promoted to the second position from the 18th. The seven wonderful words are dwongraded. The words 公 and 父 are even kicked out of top 20 and becomes between 300 and 400 in rank of AD. The relatively close group of seven wonderful words are disassemlied and deluted by 男 = male, 童, 儿 = children, 佛 = buddha, etc.</p>

  <h3>V. Contextualizational Analysis</h3>
  <section>
    <p>Brief about Contextualization.</p>
    <p>
      According to a common sense, the word Zi (son) can be defined as a male child of his parents whom he is born from. There are two criteria in the definition: one is "male", the other is the child born from parents. However, from the information extracted in the paper, it can be found that the word Zi (son) has spacials that is beyond the common definition and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>Uniqueness of Zi (son) refers to the unique features of character Zi demonstrated in pre-China documents. Some of the character may have partial feature of Zi. But as a whole, no other distinct character is similar or can compare with it.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <p>Uniqueness of Zi (Son) in pre-China</p>
      <li>
        <ol type="A">
          <li>
            <p>Broad-ranging in Usage</p>
            <p>The word Zi (son) is used in various categories of documents, covering an extensive range of topics, regardless it is direct or indirect related to sonship or not. In the features extracted, the item 1 show that 99% of Chinese documents contains the word of Zi (son). From this point, Chinese culture can be called the son-center culture. In the features extracted, the item 2 and 3 can be an solid evidence for this argument.</p>
            <p>Some may argue that there are many other Chinese words that also are broad-ranging. Like, grammatical word, 之 (Zhi), 也 (Ye) are covered in almost all ancient books. The word 人 (man) is covered in almost all philosophical works. Many scholars consider the wide-ranging of Zi (son) as a common custom of the ancient culture -- it is not worth to explore it further or deeper. They ignored an essential issue -- among all distinct Chinese characters, only the word Zi (son) has strong inconsistency between the broad-ranging usage and its common definition or sense in Chinese documents. In another word, all other broad-ranging words are reasonable. Only the word of Zi (son) is unresonable for the broad-ranging.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Special in Point</p>
            <p>The broad-ranging of the usage of Zi (son) is not equally distributed. There are two preferences that can be found through the extracted information. First, the rank and frequency of Zi (son) are unreasonbly high in documents of Ru family. (see figure-6, the red color represents Ru).</p>
            <p>Second, the rank and Frequency of Zi (son) in pre-Qin (before 221 BC) or in BC times, are significantly higher than those of documents after 221 BC or in AD times. (See Figure-7, 8). Another example can be found in two books LunYun and SanZiJIng, both of them are Ru family. LunYun belong to the work of BC, and SanZiJing belong to the work of AD. The frequency of Zi in LunYu (frequency is about 600) is about triple as much of the SanZiJing (200). (See Figure-1, 2)</p>
            <p>These two preferences demonstrate that Zi (son) has specials in tendency. The word Zi originated and thrived in Ru in pre-China before two century BC, and then expeirenced a catastrophe that caused a colapse or falling during its spreading. Some scholars blame that the event,The burning of books and burying of scholars (焚书坑儒), occured in Qin dynasty (221-206 BC), mentioned in ShiJi in the firt century BC, is the main reason for the lose of the pre-China documents and to cause the sages to cease in history.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Complexity in Sonship</p>
            <p>The special meaning of Zi (son) is far beyond the common sense defined as a male child of his parents. First, a feature of Zi (son) extracted in item 6 shows that the most frequency word followed the Zi (son) is a verb for speaking. It shed a light that the speach of the son is important. Second, the Zi (son) has close relationship with the seven wonderful words. It shed a light about the complexity of the sonship.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

      </li>
      <li>

        <p>Uniqueness in the Bible</p>
        <ol type="A">
          <li>
            <p>Broad-ranging</p>
            <p>First, in the Hebrew version of OT, among 39 books, 34 of them has word "son" (Ben), take 87%. In the Greek NT, among 27 books, 25 of them contain "son", take 92%. In overall 66 books, 58 of them contain word "son", take 87%.</p>
            <p>In Chinese Union Version (CUV), except 3John, all books have Zi (son), covering 98.4%. For STUT Chinese version of Bible, all books have word "son.", the coverage is 100%.</p>
            <p>The word son, from its first appearance in Gen 4:17 to the last in Rev 21:7, covers the whole book from the bgining to the end in the Bible.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Special in Point</p>
            <p>According to brookelester statatics (http://www.brookelester.net), the top most frequently used nouns in OT are 1) All x x5415, 2) son x4942, 3) God x2602. <!--- http://www.brookelester.net/blog/2011/3/10/frequency-lists-for-nt-greek-and-biblical-hebrew.html--Freq=10000*4942/111198=444.4324 --->
             In the OT, in average, every book will encounter 126 times of the word "son". In the book of 1 Chronicle, the word of "son" is repeated for 163 times.</p>
            <p>The fact that the frequency of "son" is higher than the frequency of the word "God" is not an accident. All sons described in the Bible, whether they are negtiely, like Cain, the first son of Adam, or positively, like Issac, the only son of Abraham, they all directly or indirectly shadow or point to a comming person who is Messiah at the OT time but manifested in the NT Time, who is Jesus Christ. The pattern of "the son of " is not a tedius repeatation, but the reminders inside of the heart again and again. In other word, the word "son" is used to predict Jesus. Without word of "son", it is impossible for the ancient prophets to predict the advent Jesus Christ.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Complixity in theology</p>
            <p>The whole Bible is about the words of God, but the most complicated issue for man is not about God, but about the dual sonship -- a person who is the son of man and the son of God. Issiah 9:6 is a typical verse to represent the such theological complexity. How could the the most important position of king is on the shoulder of a little son of man? In the NT times, the trinity issue have been argued for about five hundred years.</p>
