        The term pre-China is commonly called pre-Qin among Chinese scholars. The word "China" is a Western name given
        for <em>Qin</em> from its similar pronunciation. According to study of Chinese history, <em>Qin</em> is the
        first dynasty (221-206 BC) that unified all states into one nation in history. Hence, the term pre-Qin refers to
        the period of history before 221 BC. However, before the seventh century BC, there is no bamboo strip or any
        paper-like lengthy documents—all that archeologists could find are just pieces or sets of characters on the
        bronze-artifacts or bones. Therefore, the term pre-China or pre-China actually refer to a narrow period of time

                line that the pre-China documents can be clearly and permanently distinguished from the culture and
                religion
                of
                China from the Chinese Buddhism. After the beginning of <em>Qin</em> dynasty, although the accumulated
                materials
                are piled up like a mountain, essentially, there is nothing new among them. All of them are circular
                repetition
                or mutation with different styles. None of them ever surpassed the scope out of pre-Qin documents or
                could
                ever
                deny and replace it. It is succinct to state that "Pre-China scripture is the origin of the living water
                of

            Many people, including the Chinese people themselves, do not realize how powerful pre-Qin documents are.

            According to Chinese history, there were many foreign tribes who invaded China, but all of them were either
            assimilated or soon perished. For example, China was once conquered by the foreign Mongolian emperor Genghis
            Khan (1162–1227), but soon, the ruler's Mongolian language and culture were replaced by local Chinese. The
            Mongolian people were assimilated to become Chinese people. A state established by an alien Mongolian empire
            became part of a native dynasty of China, called the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368 AD). The trace of Mongolian
            scripts can hardly be found in China today.

            entered into China no later than 635 AD (貞觀九祀). Since then, they began to translate the Scripture (the
            twenty-four Old and twenty-seven New Testaments) and build the churches (翻經建寺). However, the thriving

            Christians are strictly not allowed to preach in public, some warm-hearted Christians greatly count on the
            government to change. On the other hand, the advanced technology has helped the ruler to quickly know what
            his people are thinking and in order to grip the power permanently, they are willing to do anything as long
            as they are stable. How much Chinese-style-Constantine can benefit the missionary is yet unknown.

            Seldom people notice that as its economics keeps growing in the world, its core value of pre-China is also

            style food. Many Chinese people, including rulers, citizens and Christians, believe that it is a great
            universal truth that "people take food as heaven." (民以食为天)—an idea from pre-China but preserved in

            It is a kind of Chinese tradition among Chinese intellectuals to believe that to quote words from pre-China

            copied from <em>LieZi</em> 列子 in pre-China documents. In the Chinese Christian Church and community, it is
            estimated that about one third to a half of the pastors directly or indirectly ever quote words from

            the worldview of pre-China documents, even though he is against the pre-China documents. To win Chinese
            intellectuals is essentially to win them back to the gospel and out of any influences of the pre-Qin
            documents. There is no compromise between the Bible and the pre-China documents. There is an invisible
            spiritual-warfare in China that is more horrible than the cultural revolution. The past two-thousand-year
            history shows that the pre-China documents still control the minds of the people in China. Now the power in

                    On the one hand, the pre-China Scripture is the foundation of the Chinese culture. They are powerful
                    and influential in history. On the other hand, its core value is difficult to describe. Joachim
                    Gentz once raised the questions "Is Confucianism a religion? Is it a philosophy or teaching of
                    ethics?" Nobody can clearly tell. Another example is the endless debates of Daoism. Many scholars
                    spent their life in studying the book of <em>LaoZi</em> or <em>DaoDeJing</em>. Some of them claimed
                    to find the secrets of the book. However, history shows that none of them escaped the scope of the
                    words in its book, "if the Dao can be defined, then it is not the Dao."

                <div p="1">
                    The pre-China does not have a fixed core value. The pre-China scripture can be best described as a
                    fuzzy set of many super elegant elements, including the concept of god, heaven, love, peace,
                    righteousness, justice, ethic, rituals, judgment, wisdom, logos, name, and so on and on. But there
                    is no clear central integrated point. It is the various scattered elements that shaped the Chinese
                    culture rather than a single core value of the pre-China scripture. The core value of pre-China
                    scripture is nothing but ambiguity. In essence, it is a mixture of truth and falsehood without
                    providing criteria for distinguishing between them.<sup title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000"

                    the words of the Serpent in Genesis 3:1-4, which is to obfuscate the Word of the Lord. History shows
                    that pre-China scripture is a powerful tool for rulers; Those who can master the pre-China documents
                    can own the state and people. The central point of pre-China scripture can drift freely from one

                <div p="1">
                    First, in theory, the pre-Qin documents refer to all documents that were written before 221 BC.
                    However, in real life, due to the poor quality of pre-Qin documents, the date of the existing
                    documents cannot be verified or confirmed. Many documents were deleted, shortened, or modified
                    during the transmission process. Some of the existing documents were believed to be fake. The poor
                    quality led to a single document having multiple different versions, which makes it more difficult
                    for dating.

                <div p="1">
                    Second, in history, there is no consensus agreement about the pre-Qin documents list. Because the
                    quality of some post-Qin documents is better than pre-Qin, many scholars would include those
                    together in the pre-Qin study. For example, <em>ShiJi</em> 史记, written in the first century BC, is
                    considered as one of the most valuable ancient documents. When study pre-Qin, <em>ShiJi</em> 史记
                    cannot be ignored.
                </div>
                <div p="1">
                    Due to those reasons, the term pre-Qin documents is indeed a fuzzy set of documents. Anyone can

                <p>Pre-China Archaic Language is Vague</p>
                <div p="1">
                    First, archaic Chinese language has no punctuation marks, which means readers can determine that
                    word grouping based on context. However, a different group could mean differently.

                <div p="1">
                    Second, unlike Hebrew, Greek, or English, every word has rich different grammatical forms (like
                    Inflections, conjugations) to identify the voice, mood, tense, number, and person. Chinese character
                    has no grammatical forms—every character is a singleton. It implies that readers can freely
                    determine the voice, mood, tense, number, and person.
                </div>
                <div p="1">
                    Third, Chinese is a zero-article language. There is no concept of an article for the noun. There is
                    no difference between the definite and indefinite nouns. Whether a noun is singular or plural,
                    specific or general, is determined by readers.

                <div p="1">
                    On the one hand, these characteristics make the Chinese language easier to learn and give readers
                    more free space for imagination. On the other hand, it is subject to cause ambiguity.
