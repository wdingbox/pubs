      <h2>The Possible "Son" Contextualization<br>
      in Ancient Chinese Documents</h2>

    <h3>Abstraction:</h3>
    <div style="display: none;">
      <p>Everyone knows the meaning of the word "son". But for its
      literally equivalent word (<em>Zi</em> 子) (<em>Zi</em>) in Chinese language, both of
      its usage and meaning, are still an unresolved mystery in its
      ancient history. For, example, why <em>Zi</em> (子) is commonly used in
      ancient books and the sage's name, like, <em>KongZi</em> 孔子
      (Confucius), <em>MenZi</em> 孟子 (Mencius), <em>LaoZi</em> 老子 (Laoism/Daoism),
      etc. This paper applied the word frequency-spectrum analysis
      along with the category-periodic comparison method to study
      the roles and characteristics of the word <em>Zi</em> in Chinese
      ancient documents. The research found that the rank and the
      density of <em>Zi</em> (子) in some specific categories of ancient
      books appears "unreasonably" high in time of BC. But it
      sharply went down and remained stable in time of AD. The
      discovery, that the similarity of the meaning of the high
      frequent prefix and suffix of <em>Zi</em> (子) during its high
      frequency period is very similar to the words that is used to
      describe the Messiah both in the OT and the NT, provides an
      important clue that could lead to the possible sonship
      contextualization -- the original meaning of "son" (<em>Zi</em> 子) in
      ancient China is likely to point to the first advent of the
      Son of God--Jesus Christ. While struggling about the
      connection between the East and the West, this study also can
      trigger Christians, missionaries and theologians today to
      further rethink the contextualizational meaning of the "son"
      in our daily life -- why Jesus Christ is described as the Son
      of man and the Son of God.</p>

          <h4 contenteditable="true">The Collection of
          Documents</h4>Following principles are considered during
          the data collection process.
          <ol type="A">
            <li>The pre-Qin documents:
              <div contenteditable="true">
                The pre-Qin documents are the primary target in
                this research.&nbsp;The term pre-Qin is also called
                pre-China. The word "China" is a western name given
                for "Qin". According to the history study, <em>Qin</em> is
                the first dynasty (221-206 BC) in history that
                unified all states into one nation. Hence, the term
                pre-Qin literally means the history before 221 BC.
                However, before around seventh century BC, there is
                no any paper-like or bamboo-strip lengthy document
                -- all the archeologists can find&nbsp; today are
                just pieces or groups of characters on bronzes or
                bones. Therefore, the term pre-Qin of documents
                actually refer to a narrow period of time between
                the seventh century BC and the second century
                BC.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                The term pre-Qin first appears in the book of
                <em>HanShu</em> in the first century AD. The reason that the
                term is widely accepted and used in history is
                probably not because of the unification of the
                warring states, but because of a key factor that
                all significant philosophical documents suddenly
                appeared during that short time period. After that,
                for more than two thousand of years, there is no
                any one that can compare with them.&nbsp;
                <div>
                  <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                  In theory, the pre-Qin documents are the
                  foundation of the Chinese culture. All basic
                  concepts and terms about the moral, politics,
                  life, worldview and faith, etc. come from the
                  pre-Qin document. The pre-Qin documents are the
                  bases of all other documents and influencing
                  people even until today. It is the pre-Qin
                  documents that cultivate the people's spiritual
                  mind that can distinguish themselves to others in
                  the world.<br>
                  From the missiological view point, the pre-Qin
                  documents is a stronghold for the missionary of
                  China.&nbsp;
                </div>
                <div>
                  <br>
                  In practice, the term of pre-Qin documents is
                  hard to follow, since there is no consensus
                  agreement on the book list for the pre-Qin
                  documents in history.&nbsp; The pre-Qin documents
                  is actually a concept of fuzzy set. This paper
                  primarily follows the list of Chinese Text
                  Project and considers about fifty of those with
                  the label of year before 221 BC as pre-Qin
                  documents.&nbsp;<br>

              </div>
            </li>
            <li>The post-Qin documents:<br>
            To be able to find the characteristics of the pre-Qin
            documents, it is necessary to compare them with other
            documents written after 221 BC, namely the post-Qin
            documents. Since the number of the Chinese ancient
            documents are extremely huge, this research only
            selected about hundred of them to balance between the
            pre-Qin and post-Qin, the important and unimportant,
            philosophical and non-philosophical documents. This
            paper selected about a hundred of documents that mainly
            from the Chinese Text Project (ctext.org).<br>
            <br></li>
            <li>The biblical and non-biblical Chinese
            documents:<br>
            The ultimate goal of the paper is to examine the
            Chinese documents from a biblical view to find a way
            for local cultural contextualization. Hence, three
            Chinese versions of the Bible are selected for
            comparison study. To enrich the comparison, the Chinese
            version of the Quran and Mormon are also included in
            the list.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            A list of the all collected documents can be seen in
            Table-1.</li>

          <h5>The Classification of the Collected Documents</h5>Two
          types of classification method are used in the research:
          the time based and the content based classification.<br>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>The Chronicle Classification<br>
              Any document can be classified according to the time
              when it was written, or the book was discovered, or
              the time that its content refers to. A most useful
              information is the date when the book was written or
              published. However, since none of the written date of
              the existing pre-Qin documents can be confirmed or
              verified, the time used here is a rough estimation
              based on the discovery, content, traditional legend,
              or reference from other 'known' books. &nbsp;
              &nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>The traditional Chinese dynasty
                classification:<br>
                Chinese tradition prefers to classify the date of
                document according to the name its associated
                dynasty. There are about two dozens of dynasties in
                China. Some of them may have an overlap in
                time.&nbsp; To simplify this, this paper import the
                Western pre-Modern concept, and to classify the
                collected documents into four periods: PreQin
                (before 221 BC), <em>QinHan</em> (221 BC - 220 AD)
                pre-Modern (220-1911 AD) and post-modern
                (1911--).<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
                <li>The biblical classification.<br>
                Not all scholars believe that the most important
                and influential Chinese documents are the pre-Qin
                documents. For example, Dr. Donald Sturgeon uses
                <em>QinHan</em> (221 BC - 220 AD) as the boundary of the
                Chinese history in his Chinese Text Project
                (ctext.org). His method expands the pre-Qin
                documents for 400 years from the year before 221 BC
                to 220 AD.&nbsp; Noticing that the middle point
                between 221 BC and 220 AD is the common era, this
                paper introduced the biblical classification method
                -- to classify any Chinese document as part of
                either BC or AD.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This paper will follow the popular date
              information. When a written date of document is
              arguable and uncertain, the paper will take an
              available one in order to go on.&nbsp; While
              following the traditional dynasty based
              classification method, this paper also combined it
              with the biblical classification method. See
              Table-1.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Content Classification:<br>
              Based its content, this paper follows two existing
              types of classification: people-oriented and the
              object-oriented classification.&nbsp;<br>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Chinese traditional people-oriented
                classification.<br>
                  The people-oriented classification method is to
                  classify an ideology, thought or content of
                  document according to the founder and its group
                  of followers, namely the family or school.&nbsp;
                  For example, <em>KongZi</em> (Confucius) and MenZi
                  (Mencius) are consistent in teaching, so they are
                  classified into Ru family; <em>LaoZi</em> and ZhuangZi are
                  similar, they are gropped to a family of Dao. The
                  people-oriented classification method can be
                  found in pre-Qin documents. For example, book
                  of&nbsp;荀子 XunZi contains criticism about
                  the&nbsp;plagiarism in Ru family. The
                  people-oriented classification can be considered
                  as one of the unique features of the pre-Qin
                  culture. After pre-Qin, for over two thousand
                  years, almost no new family or school ever
                  appeared in history.<br>
                  <br>
                  <div>
                    A critical issue in people-oriented
                    classification is that the definition of the
                    school or family cannot be clearly defined. For
                    example, today, the term Ru family is usually
                    defined as a system of philosophical and
                    ethical teachings or thoughts founded by KongZi
                    and his followers. But what the&nbsp; Ru family
                    exactly teaches about is still arguable and
                    uncertain. Character Ru cannot be found in the
                    bronzes or oracle bones. The meaning of
                    character Ru is also obscure.&nbsp; The first
                    Chinese dictionary (Shuowen jiezi 說文解字), being
                    dated back to first century CE, says, “Ru means
                    gentle and is how men of techniques are called”
                    儒, 柔也朮士之稱The scholar Liang Cai pointed out that
                    “KongZi (Confucius) did not create Ru-family
                    (Confucianism). Actually, no one ever thought
                    so.” Liang Cai pointed out that it is a puzzle
                    in history that people were turned away to
                    focus on the study of the Ru family (or
                    Confucianism).<br>
                    <br>
                    In spite of the defect of the people-oriented
                    classification, there is no better way to well
                    organized the pre-Qin document so far. How to
                    biblically classify the pre-Qin documents will
                    be a challenging work that missionaries need to
                    do in future. At the moment, this paper will
                    follow the existing people-oriented
                    classification.<br>
                    <br>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>The object-oriented classification method.<br>
                The object-oriented classification is to categorize
                the books according to the topic, or ideology. For
                example, the history, medicine, military etc. It is
                more explicit than the people-oriented
                classification.&nbsp;</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This paper will combine the traditional
              people-oriented and object-oriented classification
              method, and call them as a category.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>To combine the chronicle and content classification, a
          catetory-periodic table is created. See Table-2.</p>

          <h4>The Computation and Presentation of Data and
          Evidence</h4>
          <p>Based on the collected documents and its
          classification, a small software program is made so that
          it can generate:</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>Any frequency-spectrum for each document or for
            each category or periodic group.</li>
            <li>Any word frequency can be presented in
            category-periodic table.</li>
            <li>All prefix and suffix of <em>Zi</em> and its frequency
            spectrums.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Other data and evidence</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>book name</li>
            <li>author name,</li>
            <li>person's name.</li>
            <li>e) Trend analysis for different schools or
            chronical times. f) Compare the sonship word with other
            words.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Summery</h4><a>About 150 documents are selected in the
