<div>
<div p="1">Everyone understands that &quot;son&quot; refers to a male child of his parents. However, with such a definition, it is difficult to explain many phenomena in Chinese culture. First, the term &quot;son&quot; (<em>Zi</em> <b chnzi="zison">子</b>) was frequently used in the titles of ancient books and in the names of sages, such as <em>Kong-Zi</em> <small>孔</small><b chnzi="zison">子</b> (Confucius), <em>Meng-Zi</em> <small>孟</small><b chnzi="zison">子</b> (Mencius), <em>Lao-Zi</em> <small>老</small><b chnzi="zison">子</b> (Daoism), whereas, such pattern was not used elsewhere. Moreover, this pattern suddenly discontinued as soon as the pre-China period was over. Second, in pre-China documents, &quot;son&quot; is not only used in the names of sages but also repeatedly associated with a set of the seven words (君: gentleman, 天: heaven, 公: justice, 太: eternal, 夫: master, 王: king, 父: father) that are related to each other but obscure in distinction in Chinese. However, after the pre-China, such association is quickly diluted and replaced by secular words such as 男: male, 弟: brother, 种: seed, 童: juvenile, 佛: Buddhism, 儿: son, and 妻: wife. Third, the frequency of &quot;son&quot; (子) in pre-China documents is ranked highest among the meaningful nouns. Although the frequency sharply dropped in the post-China period, the Chinese culture can still be considered as a son-centered culture due to its influence from rulers to citizens. With the worldly human definition, it is hard to explain why &quot;son&quot; significantly appears and changes like that in Chinese culture and history. Has any metaphorical implication of &quot;son&quot;? How to explicitly understand the seven words associated with &quot;son&quot; (子) as well as the purpose of using &quot;sons&quot; in pre-China texts? These issues are still unresolved today. However, from the Christian intuition, such kind of a mystery is a contextualization potential for evangelism.</div>

<div p="1">The paper applies the word frequency-spectrum analysis method in the missiological inter-culture study on the Chinese documents. Through comparison of the features of &quot;son&quot; extracted from both the collected Chinese documents and the Bible, the paper finds that the changes of frequency-spectrum for &quot;son&quot; between the Old Testament and the New Testament are similar to the changes between the pre-China and the post-China documents. Moreover, the paper discovers that the characteristics of the prophesied wonderful Son in Isaiah 9:6-7 can perfectly match the meanings of the seven words of the seven &quot;sons&quot; frequently used in pre-Chinese documents. With such discovery, the paper asserts that the seven mysterious distinct sons in pre-China documents point to one person, the Son of God, who is Jesus Christ proclaimed in the New Testament.</div>

<div p="1">The paper finally proposes a theory that the prophecy of the advent Son was very famous throughout China before the second century BC. Pre-China documents and culture were inspired by the popular messages of the advent Son of God. However, the predictive messages in pre-China did not directly come from the prophets but the magus. The difference between prophet and magi is that a prophet can directly receive the Word from God, and his prophecy is accurate, whereas a magi can only get the oracles through signs of nature or evil spirits, and his forecast is unsure and inexplicit. Due to the sinfulness and many other reasons such as the obscure language, the pre-China people failed to identify the prophesied Son of God. They wrongly considered the Chinese sages as the predicted &quot;Son.&quot; In other words, they identified the unique Son of God with the correct seven characteristics within the wrong race, at the wrong place, and at the wrong time. The inconsistency between the seven sons and the titled sons of the ancient sages leads to the dramatic drop and significant changes of usage of &quot;son&quot; in post-China documents. Many factors further cause the predictive information missing and eventually leave a myth of &quot;son&quot; in China today, such as the disappointments, shames, anger, historical chaos, covering-up, and modification of documents.</div>
</div>
<!---- Unless this "son" refers to the advent Son of God, who is Jesus Chris, the meaning of "son" would perpetually be a mystery. All myths of the son comes from the traditional misinterpretation in the group of the seven sons.  While understanding the craftiness of evil, the evidence also shows the sinfulness of man—God already have equally revealed His Son over the land of China, but its people keep rejecting and mutating. ------->

<div p="1">The appreciation is given to my wife Jessie Li who took over the majority of housework while I was working on this paper. The same appreciation is given to my son Charles Ding who accompanied me to be baptized at ACCC in 2003, through him, I better understood the biblical meaning to have a son. Also the appreciation is given to and my old parents who raised me on earth; through them, I better understood the biblical purpose of being a son on earth.</div>

<div p="1">Great thanksgiving is given to ACCC (Atlanta Chinese Christian Church), where I was baptized and grew up, their loves, prayers, and anonymous financial support. Although I cannot remember all names, their images are in my heart forever. Especially the thanksgiving is given to my second-eastern fellowship group, the couple Jack Xiao and LiHua, who open their house and lead many (including me) to Christ.</div>

<div p="1">Many thanks are given to Perimeter Church, where, through my son&#39;s elementary Chinese classes and my adult English classes, I finally began to know the ultimate purpose of human languages&mdash;it is to know Him. I especially want to thank Mr. Krist Halthen, Ms. Christina and Mr. John Krauss, Mr. Bruce Schneider, and many people that I cannot call, for their teaching, proofreading, support and praying.</div>

<div p="1">I also want to thank all faculties, stuff and students in CIU. CIU is a great school not because of its brand name, or grand buildings, but because of the great people, their loves of Jesus Christ, their faithfulness, and their enthusiasm in poor condition of the missionary field.</div>

<div p="1">There are more thanks that I cannot enumerate them. &quot;If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room.&quot; It is through Him that my poor life turns to be full of thanks. May this thesis be a witness and return for Him.</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid2" name="uid2" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Understanding the Pre-China Documents</div>

<div p="1">Chinese accumulated documents over three and half millennium&nbsp;are the core of the Chinese culture. The pre-China documents, which were originated before Chirst, and which only take&nbsp;small parts of all Chinese documents, are the kernel of the accumulated Chinese documents. Today&#39;s Chinese worldview mainly comes from the thoughts in pre-China documents. Many literal teachings in it are similar to the biblical doctrines&nbsp;but essentially different and indeed contradict to the biblical theology. The connection of the son and Chinese god in pre-China documents is a typical example. This could be one of reasons why it is hard for people under the&nbsp;culture both&nbsp;in&nbsp;heart emotionally and in mind&nbsp;mentally to accept the Jesus Christ as the Savior. It is worth to think and explore: what is the essential goal and purpose of Chinese culture, who is manipulating the Chinese culture behind? Can&nbsp;Chinese people and Chinese culture be seperated? How can missionary bring the Gosple into the inner heart of Chinese people? From biblical perspective, is Chinese culture worth to learn and study? Why did the western messionary fail over the past one and half millinium in China land?&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">China is one of the countries which has the richest resource with continuous historical documents in the world. At the same time, it is also a place full of complexity and choatics, and it is one of the most challenging fields for missionary on cultural contextualization. To better understand the pre-China documents, it is necessary to acquire a basic knowledge of the classification of Chinese documents in its history.</div>

<div li="1"><a>A.</a> Ancient Chinese Documents</div>

<div p="1">Ancient Chinese documents (also called Historical Chinese documents, ancient Chinese books, or Ancient Chinese Scripture (ACS)) usually refer to exiting paper books or documents that were written in the Chinese language before the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. Statistics indicated that historical Chinese documents that are preseverd in various libraries and instituions in China amount to more than 30 million volumes and items, including over 2.5 million volunms of rare books and 3 million of books in oversea<sup pg="127" title="LiangruiPengandJixiongFeng2017book">[]</sup>.</div>

<div p="1">Without considering the different versions, revision, titles or duplicated copies, the total number of the identical books is about 23,000 and mainly composed of three parts. The first part is maintained by the rulers and represents the main stream of the Chinese culture. Its total number of the identical books is nearly 18,000<sup pg="" title="SiKuXiLeiCongShuMuLuSuoYin2007book">[]</sup>. In the latest official index of SiKuQuanShu(四库全书) finished in 1792, it listed 10,254 works. SiKuQuanShu was a documentation project ordered by QianLong Emperor 乾隆帝. More than 360 highest level of scholars and 3,800 scribers spent 13 years on recompiling 3,503 books into 36,000 volumns with a total of nearly 1.0 billion characters/words<sup title="SunXueQin2009book">[]</sup>. The second part of the identical books is collected in Chinese Sutra (大藏經) by Chinese Budhhists. According to the latest work published in 1997, Chinese Sutra contains 4,200 books compiled into 106 volumns with 100 million of words<sup title="RenJiYu1997book">[]</sup>. The third part of the identical books is presevered in DaoZang 道藏 by Daoists. According to the latest work published in 2004, DaoZang contains 1,500 books that is complied into 48 volumns with about 60 million of words<sup title="ZhangJiZhu2004book">[]</sup>. Compared with the number of the characters for CUV Bible that has nearly 1 million Chinese characters/words, the number of the ancient Chinese books is about 1,160 times as much in volumn as the Bible.</div>

<div li="1"><a>B.</a> The Pre-China and Post-<em>Han</em> Documents</div>

<div p="1">The history of the ancient Chinese documents has a significant watershed moment that divided the ancient Chinese documents into pre-<em>Qin</em> (先秦) and post-<em>Qin</em> documents. According to the Chinese history, <em>Qin</em> is the first dynasty (221-206 BC) that unified all states into one nation in history. Although Chinese writting system first emerged on oracle bones as early as fifteen century BC, the bamboo strip or paper-like lengthy comprehensive documents did not appear until the seventh century BC. Therefore, the term pre-<em>Qin</em> documents (or pre-China) actually refer to those written in a narrow period of time in the Spring-Autumn and Warring State dynasty (770BC&mdash;221BC).</div>

<div notes="an event The considerable diversity in thoughts between the pre-&lt;em&gt;Qin&lt;/em&gt; documents and the rest of the ancient documents is also related" p="1">In the West, the <em>Qin</em> is transliterated as &quot;China&quot;. Pre-<em>Qin</em> is also translated as pre-China. The use of the term pre-<em>Qin</em> (先秦) can be traced back to the first century AD in the book of <em>HanShu</em> 汉书. But there is no &quot;post-Qin&quot; such term in Chinese history. This is due to the event of the Burning of Books and Burying of Scholars (焚书坑儒), which occurred in <em>Qin</em> dynasty (221-206 BC), and which is mentioned in the book of <em>ShiJi</em> 史记 in the first century BC. There is no original pre-<em>Qin</em> book that can be confirmed in China today. All existing pre-<em>Qin</em> books were mainly restored by intellectuals through memory or oral legends after the burning and forbidden order. Many pre-<em>Qin</em> stories and sage&#39;s words were recorded in the historical documents during the west and east <em>Han</em> dynasty(206 BC- 220 AD) such as the famous book of <em>ShiJi</em> 史记 written by historian SiMaQian. <span>For example, the words &quot;people take food as heaven&quot; (民以食为天) comes from a story in pre-China but preserved in</span> <em>ShiJi</em> <span>史记 written in about the first century BC.</span> For this reason, each pre-<em>Qin</em> document usually has complicated various revisions spreading among people. Many scholars prefer to use the term pre-<em>Qin</em>-two-<em>Han</em> (先秦两汉) to represent pre-<em>Qin</em> documents, and use post-<em>Han</em> (后汉) to represent the rest of ancient Chinese documents. It can be seen that the watershed moment that divide ancient Chinese documents into the pre-<em>Qin</em> and post-<em>Han</em>, had a wide span for about four hundred years. Similar to the role of the gap of the intertestamental period between the OT and NT, the span helps to make it crystal clear between the pre-<em>Qin</em> and post-<em>Han</em> documents</div>

<div p="1">The considerable diversity between the pre-<em>Qin</em> and post-<em>Han</em> documents lies in the contents of thoughts. The pre-<em>Qin</em> scripture is full of creative spirits. All foundamental elements of thoughts such as the man, heaven, earth, nature, universe, state, morality, justic, logo (Dao), military, politics, life and death and so on never underwent the long-time evolution process but emerged suddenly and perfectly in forms of comprehensive documents during the seventh and second century BC. On the one hand, the unprecedented and unparalleled pre-<em>Qin</em> scripture laid down the foundation of Chinese culture and became the spiritual resource for the Chinese people. On the other hand, the super pre-<em>Qin</em> scripture build a jailhouse of worldview that its offsprings cannot transcend it. As a comparison, the post-<em>Han</em> documents essentially have nothing new but the extension of pre-<em>Qin</em> thoughts through the repetition in different forms. The most prominent novelty of the post-<em>Han</em> documents for over two thousand years in history is nothing but the influential Chinese Buddhism that is the syncretism of Chinese pre-<em>Qin</em> thoughts, India Budhhism and the Western Catholicism or Gnosticism.</div>

<div li="1"><a>C.</a> The Modern Chinese Documents</div>

<div p="1">Modern Chinese documents usually refer to existing paper or electronic books that were written in the Chinese language after the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. A prominent difference between the modern Chinese document and the previous ancient Chinese documents lies in the language style. Ancient Chinese documents use the archaic Chinese language that is awkward and hard to understand. Whereas the modern Chinese documents are written in a vulgarized langugage that is close to the oral language used in the daily life.</div>

<div p="1">The modern Chinese documents usually are about 20% more in length than the ancient documents in expression for the same content. It seems that the modern language is lengthy and verbose as compared with the archaic language. Indeed, under the influence of the Western culture, the modern Chinese language is more accurate than the archaic language when describing a concept related to mood, tense, number, and person. The archaic language usually looks like a compressed text. It seems succinct, but the archaic language is obscure.</div>

<div p="1">Although it only took about a hundred years, the quantity of the various modern Chinese books has surpassed the total number of all ancient Chinese documents. According to a report, the total number of ISBN applied for the Chinese books in 2019 in Taiwan is 43,363 pieces<sup title="NationalCentralLibrary107report">[]</sup>. The number of the new book published in a year in 2019 in Taiwan is as twice as much of all ancient Chinese books in the past two-thousand years. People today is living in a flood of words. While people get free from the native developing cultural state, they are in threat of a bigger literal torrent of the globalization.</div>

<div p="1">The modern Chinese literature essentially differs to the previous ancient documents not merely on its literature style or quantity but more importantly on that the modern Chinese documents are heavily influenced by the Western culture. A large amount of influential modern works are not written by Chinese but translated from the Western books. Among those, the most significant work is the Chinese Union Version (CUV) of the Chinese language Bible published in April 22, 1919 by protestant missionaries<sup title="ZetzscheJostOliver1999book">[]</sup>.</div>

<div p="1">The publication of the CUV Chinese language Bible represents not only a typical feature of the modern Chinese documents, but also the turning point of the Chinese culture that began to change itselves from Confucius, Buddhism and Daoism to a brand new Christian worldview before the end of the day.</div>

<ol type="A">
</ol>

<div p="1">If the Chinese historical documents are considered as the source codes for the Chinese culture, then the pre-<em>Qin</em> books can be considered as the codes for the kernal operating system of Chinese culture. Any missionary who wants to study the Chinese culture is necessary to study the ancient Chinese documents. However, it is impossible for a person in his life to read all ancient Chinese documents with his nake eyes. It is a trend for scholars to make use of computer tecnology for research. A novelty in this paper is to apply the digital technology to find evidence to solve the inter-cultural and theological issues, which avoid the circular debating on the meaning of the obscure archaic texts based on the biases.</div>

<div subpagesize="4"><a id="uid3" name="uid3" subpage_idx="">2.</a> The Mystery of &quot;Son&quot; In Pre-China Documents</div>

<div p="1">To understand the meaning of Chinese character <em>Zi</em> (Son) is the key to uncover the mysterious veil of Chinese writings and culture. To understand the Chinese writings and culture is important for Chinese to understand &quot;who I am&quot;.</div>

<div p="1">According to the common sense, the word &quot;son&quot; can be defined as a male child born from his parents. There are two criteria: one is &quot;male,&quot; the other is &quot;child.&quot; However, with such definition and criteria, more and more Chinese scholars began to find that its usage and meaning cannot fit the context of the pre-China documents. They found many extraordinary features that associate with &quot;son&quot; in the pre-China documents.</div>

<div p="1">When &quot;son&quot; is used in the person&#39;s name in the early Shang and Zhou dynasty, it is always related to the royal family members. Some scholars found that, during the Spring and Autumn period, &quot;son&quot; represented a political power and had cultural influence. As the royal members and political persons went down, the word &quot;son&quot; became a meaningless form spreading in the society <sup title="XuGuanLan2010">[]</sup> and gradually changed to become a suffix existing in culture<sup title="LiQi2003">[]</sup> <sup title="KongDeYu2009article">[]</sup> <sup title="YanLi2008article">[]</sup> <sup title="ZhangLiXia2007article">[]</sup> and remained until today. Most scholars believe that &quot;son&quot; is used in the title to express respectfulness.<sup title="HanHuaMei1997article">[]</sup> <sup title="ChengXiuLi2000">[]</sup> <sup title="XiaXianPei1997">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Some scholars found that &quot;son&quot; has a meaning of &#39;god&#39; or &#39;diviner&#39; <sup title="ZhuangYuJie2014">[]</sup>. A scholar also found that &quot;son&quot; may contain &quot;mysticism&quot; in it.<sup title="WangGuangCong1992">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Some scholars found that both <em>Zi</em> 子 and <em>Er</em> <i>儿</i> have the same meaning to express &quot;male child&quot;. Sometimes, they are mutual exchangeable. Whereas, the difference is that <em>Er</em> <i>儿</i> is used for low-class family, containing some negative derogatory meaning.<sup title="ZhuXiaoNa2008">[]</sup> <sup title="ZhouXueXi2016mastersthesis">[]</sup> <sup title="ZhaoNa2012article">[]</sup> <sup title="LiChangTai2009article">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">When <em>Zi</em> 子 is used with Jun 君 in pre-China documents, many scholars found that the phrase <em>JunZi</em> 君子 is related to &quot;love&quot;, &quot;righteousness&quot;, &quot;braveness&quot;, &quot;wisdom&quot;, &quot;faithful&quot;, &quot;adequate (middle)&quot;<sup title="ZhangYiMing2018mastersthesis">[]</sup> <sup title="LiWeiJie2015mastersthesis">[]</sup> As a contrast to the Bible, DuJunPu considered <em>JunZi</em> 君子 as a model of <em>Ru</em> family, and the righteous man (<em>YiRen</em> 义人) as a model of Christianity. He found that both of them have many similarities and connections regarding how to be a positive perfect man.<sup title="DuJunPu2017article">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">A Chinese researcher found that the phrase <em>ZiYue</em> 子曰 (Son-Speak) frequently appears at the beginning of books or chapters in pre-China documents. He proposed a theory that this form was used on purpose to gain authenticity and authority<sup title="JinLinKe2006article">[]</sup> while containing friendship and equality among people.</div>

<div p="1">The pre-China documents have been studied for two thousand years in history. But no scholar ever considered the term &quot;son&quot; as an issue in history. Historical information about the special meaning of &quot;son&quot; is very limited and not very useful. Many scholars considered the special usage of &quot;son&quot; as an traditional custom without reasons. It is only in recent years that Chinese scholars began to admit that it is a mystery rather than &quot;as-is&quot; known in history. To be able to doubt the traditional teachings to explore a new meaning of &quot;son&quot; is a breakthrough in the study of Chinese culture. However, although more than dozens of papers or theses have been published within ten years in China, the origin, the meaning, the usage and property of &quot;son&quot; in Chinese culture is still a myth for today. <sup title="XiaXianPei1992article">[]</sup></div>

<div subpagesize="2"><a id="uid4" name="uid4" subpage_idx="">3.</a> The Need for Contextualization In China</div>

<div p="1">Contextualization as a missiological inter-cultural study method is relative new for many Chinese Christians as comparied with indigenization (本土化). So far there is no consensus Chinese translation yet. Contextualization can be translated as 福音化 or 福音解读 in Chinese. As the Christianity growing rapidly, the delimma of the native traditional worldview becomes more and more acute. Pastors or missionaries have to give Chinese audiens a solution whether they keep the Eastern traditional faith, or choose the Western Christianity, or compromise between the two. Whether it is for Christians or Gentles, contextualization is the best approach for missionaries who preach in China.</div>

<div p="1">Facing the myths such as &quot;son&quot; in pre-Chinese culture, missionary should be able to stand out to liberate people from the erroneous or evil interpretation of natural phenomema. &quot;the myth may include some historical data, it characteristically will reach far beyond history into fantasy. While the myth may contain something of truth, characteristically it will mix truth and falsehood without providing criteria for distinguishing between them.&quot;<sup pg="p131" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> With the Gospel as the preaching criteria, the myth provdies the missionaries the raw materials and good opportunity for contextualization and evangelism. Whether it is the scientific evidence or spiritual witness, the contextualization will always be the genuineness and authenticity that can attest to the effectiveness of the persuasion.</div>

<div p="1">However, over the past century, missionaries failed to effectively utilize the contextualization approach as a tool for evangelism in Chinese fields or conmunities, at least it is not very successful for them in the pre-China documents contextualization. What they most focused in contextualization process is on seeking similarities or connections between the Bible and the pre-China documents. For example, in the book, &quot;The Daoism: The Parting of the Way&quot; (1957), the author&#39;s efforts are mainly based on the theme of <a q="1" title="p5">&quot;...&quot;</a><sup title="HolmesWelch1957Book">[]</sup> In the master thesis, &quot;A Comparative Study of the Concept of Wisdom on the Book of Wisdom and the Tad-Teh-Ching&quot; (1969)<sup title="BenedictSungHaeKin1969Master">[]</sup>, the author systematically explored the similarities about the concept of &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;immortality&quot; between the Dao-De-Jing and the Book of Wisdom in Septuagint.</div>

<div p="1">Recently, under the influence of the Chinese-style-Christianity, more and more Chinese secular scholars also began to study the Bible in a Chinese way to develop, defense and glorify the Chinese culture. A scholar states that Chinese classical documents have their own hermeneutics that was ignored in history. The difference is that Chinese hermeneutics and the classical documents are indivisible, whereas, the biblical hermeneutics can be an independent branch of science.<sup title="KangYu2018Article">[]</sup> After comparing the <em>LunYu</em> and the Bible, a scholar proposes a multi-Him theory. He tries to compromise the role of personal perception in <em>Ru</em>-family and the biblical Sola Fide (By Faith Alone) principle.<sup title="LinAnYu2019Article">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">The most influential book regarding contextualization potential of the pre-China documents to the Christian faith is the book, &quot;老子 VS 圣经-跨越时空的迎候 [LaoZi and The Bible: A Meeting Transcending Time and Space]&quot;(1997)<sup title="YuanZhiming2010">[]</sup> The author is the famous Chinese pastor <em>Yuan ZhiMing</em>. He systematically and thoroughly explored the nature and characteristics of the pre-China scripture. The author discovered many similarities between the book of <em>DaoDeJing</em> and the Bible. The pastor captured in three major propositions: <a q="1" title="p5a">&quot;...&quot;</a><sup title="EvanChenYihHsu2006">[]</sup> <!--- unprecedentedly
      
      This book vividly recaptures God's universal light shown to the Chinese sage <em>Lao</em> Tzu 600 years before Jesus was born. 
      
      By comparing LaoZi's book of <em>DaoDeJing</em> with the Bible, Yuan Zhiming offers a ground-breaking interpretation of <em>Lao</em> Tzu's Tao in light of the Word, or Logos. Yuan Zhiming juxtaposes <em>Lao</em> Tzu's \"Holy One\" with Jesus Christ, systematically and thoroughly unveiling the nature and characteristics of the mysterious Tao in a concrete and understandable manner, resolving a riddle of 2,600 years. \"The text speaks to our time, because so many people believe that mere secular teaching of \"morality,\" such as Confucius taught, is sufficient, and because what we really need is a deep spiritual awakening, such as <em>Lao</em> Tzu announced. 
      
      The profound teaching in <em>Lao</em> Tzu and the Bible enriches the spirit of not only the Chinese people but also the people of the West.\" -Dr. Paul de Vries, president of New York Divinity School and author of 
      
      The Taming of the Shrewd <em>Lao</em> Tzu and the Bible 
      
      offers not only a spiritual feast to the analytical minds about Tao/Word/Logos, illustrating Tao in a tangible form, the Holy One/Jesus Christ, but also provides helpful advice about how to follow and be united with Tao. A work of great erudition and wisdom, it contains deep insight, opening up the secrets of the Tao while also illuminating the Bible. This book will surely delight the hearts and minds of seekers of Tao." ----></div>

<div p="1">Pastor Yuan&#39;s book has some critical issues. First, the book put <em>LaoZi</em> and the Bible together at the same level, which indirectly equalized the pre-China scripture with the Bible. The author ignored the facts of the poor quality and poor credentials of the pre-China scripture that cannot compare with the canonized infallible and inerrant Bible. Second, to lead Chinese to Christ by promoting the pre-China documents could cause Chinese-style-Christians, such as Christian nationalists, Christian patriotists, or even Christian communists. Third, the evidence that the author found in the book cannot overturn the essential property of the ambiguity of pre-China documents, including <em>DaoDeJing</em>. The bold conclusions that the author proposed is subject to be attacked by atheists that he tried to make use of the uncertainty in pre-China documents to attract people to the Christianity.</div>

<div p="1">In a word, the gospel and the pre-China documents are not compromisable. Christianity should not and cannot follow the way of Chinese-Buddhism to create a compromised new Chinese-style-Christianity by sacrificing the core theological value through the modification. From the missiological viewpoint, it is suitable for Christianity either to survive or to disappear in China. A syncretistic Chinese-style-Christianity would be a heresy that will be more complicated and challenging for the missionary. Preaching the gospel is easier than criticizing the heresy to produce the fruits. At the moment, contextualization is probably the best way that can prevent Christianity from being assimilated by the influential Chinese culture.</div>

<!----  ----->

<div p="1">The paper will consider the mystery of word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Zi</em> 子) in Chinese documents as a good opportunity to preach the Gospel among the Chinese gentiles. It will use the Chinese documents as historical data to find out the textual features of the Chinese character &quot;son&quot; (<em>Zi</em> 子) both statically in pre-China period and dynamically throughout the history.

<div>Based on the discovered features of word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Zi</em> 子) in Chinese documents, the paper will further exam the corresponding features of &quot;son&quot; (Hebrew: בן (<em>Ben</em>), Greek: &upsilon;&iota;ό&sigmaf; (<em>huios</em>)) in the Bible and explore the relationship between the two through the comparison and analysis.</div>

<div>Based on the similarity of the featured discovered between the two, the paper will apply the contextualization method to establish the internal connection of the meaning of &quot;son&quot; among Chinese word <em>Zi</em> 子 in pre-China documents, Hebrew word <em>Ben</em> בן in the Old Testament and Greek word <em>huios</em> &upsilon;&iota;ό&sigmaf; in the New Testament.</div>

<div>Through the discovered evidence, the paper is to convince that the mysterious unknown meaning of the word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Zi</em> 子) originated in Chinese pre-<em>Qin</em> documents has the same role and meaning as it has in the Bible. The conclusion of contextualization is to testify that Jesus Christ who was considered as irrelevant and alient to Chinese culture is already predicted in China land as early as two and a half millenniums ago and is indeed the foundation of the Chinese culture all the time. The research suggests a new attitude toward rich Chinese documents: Chinese documents are not the spiritual food but the big historical data containing truth and falsehood without criteria.</div>

<div subpagesize="8"><a id="uid10" name="uid10" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Contextualization</div>

<div li="A"><a>A.</a> Understanding of Contextualization:</div>

<div p="1">The word &quot;contextualization&quot; comes from the root word &quot;context&quot; which further comes from the root &quot;text&quot; which means the message. The word &quot;context&quot; literally means the surrounding information associated with a specific message. &quot;contextuality&quot; means all possible surrounding information that could associate with and influence the message. Its adjective form is &quot;contextual&quot; meaning &quot;message related.&quot; The term &quot;contextualize,&quot; which is reserved in missiology and theology, refers to finding or exploring any message in a local culture that could be associated or connected with the universal, perpetual truth of the gospel. Its noun form is &quot;contextualization.&quot;</div>

<div p="1">Contextualization, culture, and theology are indivisible. They all have a simultaneous beginning from any communication between God and man, even though the term contextualization was not coined until 1972 in the publication of &quot;Ministry in Context: The Third Mandate Program of the Theological Education Fund (TEF)&quot; (1970-77) at Bromley of England.<sup oldx="3" pg="p.27-9." title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> TEF was launched by International Missionary Council(IMC) at its Ghana assembly in 1957-58.<sup oldx="3" pg="p.27-9." title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> Shoki Coe (Taiwanese Hwang Chang Hui,黄彰辉,1914-1988) was &quot;honored around the world for the effective use of the term &lsquo;contextualization&rsquo; to explain how one should construct relevant theologies.&quot;<sup oldx="4" pg="p.7" title="MPJosephPoHoHuangandVictorHsu2018">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Coe presented his paper &quot;In Search of Renewal in Theological Education&quot; in the World Council of Churches Consultation in 1972, and published in 1973.<sup oldx="5" pg="p.77-78." title="RayWheeler0001">[]</sup> Coe considers the contextualization as the way towards reform in theological education. He states that &quot;in using the word contextualization, we try to convey all that is implied in the familiar term indigenization, yet seek to press beyond for a more dynamic concept which is open to change and which is also future-oriented.&quot;<sup oldx="6" pg="p.239-241" title="ShokiCoe1973">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">At first, not all scholars agreed upon the usage of the term &quot;contextualization.&quot; In the late 1970s, James O. Buswell III argued that the term did not necessarily improve on older terms such as indigenous, indigeneity, and indigenization.<sup oldx="7" pg="p.33" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> Bruce Fleming believed that &quot;the word was already so tinted by liberal presuppositions and so tarnished with misunderstanding and confusion that it should be laid to rest forthwith.&quot; He proposed the usage of a new term for contextualization: context-indigenization.<sup oldx="7" pg="p.33" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> However, by that time, &quot;most conservative evangelicals were already enamored with the word contextualization&quot;<sup oldx="7" pg="p.33" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> They believed that the term could reveal both the sensitivity to the local context and fidelity to Scripture. &quot;The contextualization proposal was made at a time when indigenization was accepted as a rational mission strategy as well as the ecclesiastical practice in Asian and African countries.&quot;<sup oldx="8" pg="p.7, 9." title="MPJosephPoHoHuangandVictorHsu2018">[]</sup> Contextualization not only required reflection on the history of both the OT and the NT, it also assumed consideration of the history of the Church and its mission in each ear.</div>

<div p="1">So far, there are still some definitional nuances of contextualization. Different scholars define it differently depending on the emphasis placed upon Scripture and the cultural setting. To better understand contextualization wholly and accurately, it is necessary to look at various definitions from different scholars as to the following.</div>
&nbsp;

<div p="1">In general, contextualization is a way for Christians to appropriately express the experiences after experiencing rebirth and to share or apply that message in the missionary field among the nations. Contextualization aids in understanding Scripture through the perspective of a native cultural context and identify universal biblical principles so that the unique gospel can permeate into every specific culture all over the world. The essence of contextualization is to bear an effective witness to the incarnation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. &quot;Contextualization itself is not the goal. Connecting redemptively with the lost is the goal.&quot;<sup oldx="[20]" pg="p.430." title="KevinGreeson2012">[]</sup></div>

<div li="B"><a>B.</a> Risks of Contextualization:</div>

<div p="1">While contextualization is very compelling, it has inherent dangers in practice for Christians. Since as an approach, the contextualization can be used reversely, that is, to take a Bible text out the biblical context. David Pawson once said, &quot;God doesn&#39;t give you a text as motto to hang up on the wall divorced from the context in which he original said those words. He gives you a verse from the Bible because you are in the similar situation to the one in which He first said that. Therefore, if God gives you a verse of Scripture, you need always go and read the chapter in which that verse occurs. Because He is not giving you those words just out of the blue.&quot;<sup pg="0:50" title="DavidPawson1982webpage">[]</sup> &quot;Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.&quot; (2Tim 2:15)</div>

<p>(1) Syncretism</p>

<div p="">One of the biggest threat of contextualization comes from the syncretism, which essentially converts the Gospel to an unbiblical message subordinated to the local culture. To prevent the contextualization from being misused, it is important to understand how contextualization distincts from syncretism.</div>

<div p="1">Van Rheenen stated that &quot;syncretism cannot be defined without an understanding of contextualization since the two processes are interrelated.&quot; <sup oldx="[21]" pg="chap.1." title="VanRheenenGailyn2006">[]</sup> One person&rsquo;s &ldquo;contextualization&rdquo; could be considered &ldquo;syncretism&rdquo; by another. A successful &ldquo;contextualization&rdquo; for today can become the syncretism of tomorrow. Van Rheenen stated that &quot;We must realize that we are always, to some degree, syncretistic, and acknowledge our syncretism before God and fellow Christians.&quot; <sup oldx="[22]" pg="chap.1." title="VanRheenenGailyn2006">[]</sup> Paul Hiebert pointed out that &quot;there is always the danger that when we put the gospel in human contexts that the essence of the gospel will be so distorted that it loses its message. God also starts with us where we are and reveals himself to us more fully as we grow in the knowledge of our Lord.&quot; <sup oldx="[23]" pg="chap.2." title="VanRheenenGailyn2006">[]</sup> Kevin Greeson affirms, &quot;Contextualization is risky business that dances on the edge of gospel contamination, missionaries should invite all eyes and ears to examine their contextualization practice.&quot; <sup oldx="[24]" pg="p. 425." title="KevinGreeson2012">[]</sup> Gailyn Van Rheenen pointed out, &ldquo;When religious expressions of a culture are adopted or even contextualized, it has the potential of legitimizing the practices and eventually leading to syncretism.&quot; <sup oldx="[25]" pg="chap.1." title="VanRheenenGailyn2006">[]</sup> Wherever contextualization occurs, there exists the potential for syncretism.</div>

<div p="1">One common approach is to adapt the Christian terms or message to indigenous forms. However, if not done carefully and thoughtfully, the results could lead to a &quot;secular meaning of Christ.&quot;<sup oldx="[26]" pg="p.76, 78." title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> and destroy the evangelical effort. For example, some Christians translate the Buddhist &ldquo;teaching monk&rdquo; as &quot;pastor,&quot; Buddhism &ldquo;temple&rdquo; as &quot;church,&quot; Buddhism &quot;teaching&quot; as &quot;preaching,&quot; etc. On the one hand, this practice of contextualization has helped Buddhists to understand Christianity. On the other hand, it has facilitated the Buddhists to absorb some ideas of Christianity and to apply them into the Buddhism teaching. As a result, the Buddhism is developed and thrived but Christianity become withered. The inscription text on the Nestorian Stele is typical evidence to historically demonstrate such poor contextualization as syncretism. In recent years, some Chinese Buddhism leaders even entitle Jesus as a Buddha in their public teachings<sup pg="4:10" title="JingKongMonk2011webpage">[]</sup>&mdash;with a typical &quot;Christ-Centered Syncretism&quot;, they try to inject a &quot;secular meaning of Christ&quot; into the Christianity.<sup pg="p.73,76" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">&quot;Syncretism is the blending of Christian beliefs and practices with those of the dominant culture so that Christianity loses its distinctiveness and speaks with a voice reflective of its culture.&quot; &quot;Frequently syncretism is birthed out of a desire to make the gospel relevant.&quot; <sup oldx="[27]" pg="chap.1." title="VanRheenenGailyn2006">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">In a word, syncretism can be defined as the unconscious, subconscious or conscious amalgamation of different religions, cultures, or thoughts with the gospel to form a new distinct one to adapt itself through reconciliation. Syncretism has two important symptoms that can differentiate it from good contextualization: 1) self losing due to reconciliation or compromise; 2) producing innovative new schools that are similar to but different from their original ones. Just like what Heibert stated, &quot;in one sense, syncretism is a message that has lost the heart of the gospel. In another sense, it is moving in the wrong direction, away from a fuller knowledge of the gospel.&quot; <sup oldx="[28]" pg="chap.1." title="VanRheenenGailyn2006">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">The essential difference between contextualization and syncretism is not merely based on its symptoms, but lies in the internal motivation from the deepest inner heart: contextualization is to witness or glory Jesus Christ only, whereas, syncretism, sometimes seemingly looks like contextualization, but essentially is to utilize the name of Jesus and the gospel to serve or glorify something else openly or secretly rather than Jesus Christ. If the syncretism is considered as the perversion of the Gospe, then contextualization is the antonym of the perversion.</div>

<div p="1">Jesus said that, &quot;Watch out; be aware of the leaven of Pharisees and the leaven of Herod&quot; (Mark 8:15). One way to prevent Christianity from being lost its core gospel message is to spiritually keep distance to any local culture. &quot;It appears that the only assurance of maintaining orthodoxy in Christian teaching and practice is abstinence from overtly non-Christian religious expressions.&quot; <sup oldx="[29]" pg="p.197." title="VanRheenenGailyn2006">[]</sup> &quot;Good contextualization seeks to be faithful to Scripture and meaningful to a given culture.&quot; <sup oldx="[30]" pg="" title="WuJackson2015">[]</sup> A successful contextualization not only can help people to get out of the prison of its culture and to quickly turn to Jesus Christ, but also can help believers to deeper or better understand the meaning of the gospel, to enrich their theological knowledge, and to allow the hidden characters of Christ to be revealed and glorified.</div>

<p>(2) Indigenization</p>

<div p="1">In missiology, indigenization means to allow the seed of the gospel to stay, to live, to grow, and to produce fruits naturally in a particular local culture.</div>

<div p="1">Contextualization differs from indigenization in that indigenization focuses on local traditional culture statically, whereas, contextualization focuses more on the universal, perpetual translatable truth.</div>

<div p="1">Coe stated that &quot;indigenous, indigeneity, and indigenization all derive from nature metaphors, that is, of the soil, or taking root in the soil.&quot; Because of the static nature of the metaphor, &quot;indigenization tends to be used in the sense of responding to the gospel in terms of traditional culture. Therefore, it is in danger of being past-oriented.&quot; Moreover, due to the globalization and rapid advanced technology development in the world, all local culture is experiencing radical change, which makes the indigenization hard to fit in. <sup oldx="[31]" pg="p.240." title="ShokiCoe1973">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">As a comparison, it seems that indigenization respects the local culture more than contextualization&ndash;it views all cultures as equally valid and important. While contextualization will challenge the local culture with the translatable biblical truth of the gospel, contextualization confirms that it is not its goal to judge, change or destroy the local culture, but to discern and to fulfill it.</div>

<ol type="A"><!----p>The missiological or theological term contextualization was effectively advocated by Shoki Coe (Taiwanese Hwang Chang Hui,黄彰辉,1914-1988). In his paper In Search of Renewal in Theological Education, which was published in 1973, Coe considered the contextualization as the way towards reform in theological education, "in using the word contextualization, we try to convey all that is implied in the familiar term indigenization, yet seek to press beyond for a more dynamic concept which is open to change and which is also future-oriented."</p-------->

<div subpagesize="3"><a id="uid11" name="uid11" subpage_idx="">2.</a> Data-Mining Method</div>

<div p="1">There are three reasons to apply the data-mining method in the research. First, it is to avoid endless subjective debates in ambiguous pre-China thoughts. Second, a person cannot read all the Chinese documents. Third, the Chinese language is simple for computer analysis since it has no grammatical form. The computer-based data-mining approach provides a more objective and instantaneous method to study the pre-China scripture.</div>

<div li="A"><a>A.</a> Understanding Data-Mining</div>

<div p="1">In computer engineering, data-mining is a method or process to dig through data to discover hidden connections and predict future trends. The term &quot;data-mining&quot; was coined in the early 1990s. &ldquo;its foundation comprises three intertwined scientific disciplines: statistics (the numeric study of data relationships), artificial intelligence (human-like intelligence displayed by software and/or machines) and machine learning (algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions). What was old is new again, as data-mining technology keeps evolving to keep pace with the limitless potential of big data and affordable computing power. Data-mining helps people to sift through all the chaotic and repetitive noise in data, to understand what is relevant and then make good use of that information to assess likely outcomes.&rdquo; <sup oldx="[48]" pg="" title="TechGroupDatamining2019webpage">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Data-mining helps people to connect or link a new portion of data to the data that is already stored and understood. This immediately brings us about the concept of &ldquo;linked,&rdquo; where &ldquo;linked&rdquo; is interpreted as a sublimate of &ldquo;understood.&rdquo; We have written a &ldquo;sublimate&rdquo; because having data linked is not yet sufficient, though necessary for the further, more intelligent phase of building knowledge out of data. After data have been linked, data and knowledge mining, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition, diagnostics, prediction, etc. could be done more effectively and efficiently. <sup oldx="[49]" pg="p.29" title="RajendraAkerkar2014book">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Data-mining is sometimes referred to as &quot;Knowledge Discovery in Databases,&quot; (KDD). It is developed when &ldquo;there is an urgent need for a new generation of computational theories and tools to assist humans in extracting useful information (knowledge) from the rapidly growing volumes of digital data. The basic problem addressed by the KDD process is one of mapping low-level data into other forms that might be more compact, more abstract, or more useful. Data-mining is a step in the KDD process that consists of applying data analysis and discovery algorithms that produce a particular enumeration of patterns (or models) over the data.&rdquo; <sup oldx="[50]" pg="p.38-40" title="UsamaFayyadandGregoryPiatetskyShapiroandPadhraicSmythFall1996">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">There are many techniques that can be used in data-mining. For example, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic representation language method. It is intended to abstract away from syntactic representations, in the sense that sentences which are similar in meaning should be assigned the same AMR, even if they are not identically worded. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet Method) is a method through analyzing a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. This paper will only use the Word Frequency-Spectrum Analysis method.</div>

<div li="B"><a>B.</a> Understanding the Word Frequency-Spectrum Analysis</div>

<div p="1">The term Word Frequency-Spectrum (WFS) in this paper is indeed a graphic form for a Sorted Word Lists by Frequency, where the vertical Y-axis representing the frequency value, the horizontal X-axis representing the index of the sorted list. Frequency refers to the repeated occurrence of a word or character over a specific document or a particular category of documents. The frequency value could be an integer number of the repeated occurrence, or a ratio of the number of the occurrence to the given size of its document. The ratio could be in the form of a percent (pc) or in the form of per 10,000 words (pm).</div>

<div p="1">The WFS analysis method is derived from the concept of Zipf&#39;s principle in terms of quantitative linguistics study. Zipf&#39;s principle states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its index of rank in the frequency table. Corpus refers to the sealed document or text. The WFS analysis method is to extract meaningful information of a document through its frequency or rank of words. In general, the higher the frequency or rank of a word is, the more important it is.</div>

<div li="B"><a>C.</a> Significance of the Data-Mining</div>

<div p="1">Data-Mining approach considers the Chinese documents as historical data rather than the teachings. This can help to minimize the chance of spiritual contamination before producing a more objective and clean conclusion. The historical Chinese documents are not the healthy spiritual food but mixed with nutritions and poisons, truth and falsehood without providing the criteria.</div>

<div p="1"><span>Without considering the different religions, versions, revision, titles or duplicated copies, the total number of the identical ancient Chinese books is about 23,000. Adding the modern Chinese books, the total number could surpass millions. Although most of books or documents have been digitalized, to collect and scan all of these books through computer is still a heavy burden. For this reason, the paper applies a non-random sampling method to collect about a hundred and fifty of books in study. (see <a title="#Table-12">Table-12.</a> in appendix)</span>

<div><span>The so-called non-random sampling method means to carefully select the samples that can best represent the features of all data. To minimum the possible bias during the data collection, the paper considers several factors in balance.</span></div>

<div><span>As the pre-China documents are the foundation of the Chinese culture, and the number of the pre-China documents is relatively small (about fifty in total), as much as about all existing pre-China documents will be collected in the study.</span></div>

<div><span>As <em>Qin</em>-<em>Han</em> documents contains large amount of the text of pre-China, these documents will be collected as much as possible.</span></div>

<div><span>The documents after <em>Han</em> and before 1992 AD are called pre-modern documents. As its number is huge, the paper will only collect the most influential and popular Chinese traditional Confucius Daoism books and Buddhism books.</span></div>

<div subpagesize="8"><a id="uid14" name="uid14" subpage_idx="">2.</a> Document Classification</div>

<div>
<div p="1">Document classification is a process to assign a document to a specific group or class that that shares some common features. Two types of classification methods are used in the research: the time-based and the content-based classifications.</div>

<div li="A"><a>A.</a> Time-Based Classification:</div>

<div p="1">Time series classification in this paper is to deal with classifying the existing documents concerning the writing date in order to extract the time series information from the documents, such as word frequency-spectrum. The most challenging work in the time series classification in this research is that the written dates of the existing Chinese documents cannot be determined accurately. Moreover, many documents do not have reliable information; they are full of puzzles. In recognition of this situation, this paper proposes a dual time series classification method: one is the simplified Chinese traditional dynasty series classification, and the other is the Christian era classification method.</div>
&nbsp;

<div p="1">In summary, two time-based classification methods are applied in the research at the same time: the simplified dynasty-series classification and the Christian era classification. These two types of classification represent not only the difference in periodic time, but also in the cultures between the eastern and the Western.</div>

<div p="1">Due to the defect of the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents that the written date is full of uncertainty, it would be too narrow to study the documents written before 221 BC, and it would be too broad for those written before 220 AD. As a comparison, Christian era classification with the date before 1AD can better reflect the nature of the date for pre-<em>Qin</em> documents study. This paper combined the two methods into one for research. For the selected book count and word count in different periods, see <a title="#Table-2">Table-2</a>, <a title="#Table-3">Table-3</a>.</div>

<div li="B"><a>B.</a> Categorization</div>

<div p="1">Document Categorization is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories. Two basic methods are popular in Chinese documents: family-based and the content-based classification.</div>
&nbsp;

<div p="1">This paper will combine the traditional family-cased and content-based classification methods, and consider them as a single category.</div>

<ol type="A">
	<li>
	<div li="a"><a>a.</a> The Simplified Chinese Dynasty Series Classification:</div>

	<div p="1">The simplified Chinese dynasty series classification method comes from the traditional Chinese dynasty series classification method that is used to classify the ancient documents according to the respective dynasty in history. Pre-<em>Qin</em> can be considered as the most popular and successful dynasty classification period in Chinese history. The traditional method has encountered many issues for today. First, a dynasty could be long or short. For example, a book of the <em>Han</em> Dynasty could have been written at any time between 206 BC and 220 AD. Second, there are about two dozen dynasties in history. Some of them may overlap. As the Gregorian system became more and more popular after the twentieth century in China, the traditional dynasty-based classification seemed to be more and more awkward. Third, dynasty classification is a personal dictatorship-based chronicle method. It helps to remember the ruler&rsquo;s name, but that does not reflect the features of its society.</div>

	<div p="1">This paper introduces the Western pre-modern and post-modern concepts into the traditional dynasty classification, and proposed a simplified dynasty series of four-periods classification model: PreQin (before 221 BC), <em>QinHan</em> (221 BC - 220 AD), pre-modern (220-1911 AD) and post-modern (1911--present).</div>

	<div p="1">In the West, pre-modern is the period which came before modernity. Modern society began in Europe after the introduction of the Industrial society and large-scale production. There is no precise date for the division. Some scholars prefer to apply the date of 1698, when the first steam engine was invented by James Watt (1736-1819) as the end of the pre-modern or the beginning of the post-modern.</div>

	<div p="1">In China, for many scholars the pre-modern period refers to the time before the end of the Great Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). From the perspective of the document research, two reasons support this. First, after 1911, the Chinese vulgarization began to spread. It is the first time in history that the people began to seek the identical balance between the oral language and writing language. Second, the first full version of the Chinese Bible, which is in the Chinese vernacular language, also called the Chinese union version, was published in 1919. Chinese documents had a significant difference after 1911. This can be seen in the research in this paper.</div>

	<div li="b"><a>b.</a> The Christian Era Classification:</div>

	<div p="1">The Christian era, also called the Common Era, is the period of time that begins with the traditional date of Christ&#39;s birth. It is also called AD (from the Latin <em>anno</em> <em>Domini</em>, after the year of our Lord). The period before AD is called BC (abbreviated from Before Christ).</div>

	<div p="1">The Christian era classification and the Chinese pre-<em>Qin</em> classification are more or less similar in that both have one specific epoch. The period of pre-<em>Qin</em> in China has the same significance as the AD period in the West. From a bird&#39;s eye view of the history of the world, 221 BC and 1 AD are close enough in proximity that there is little substantial difference. The difference is that pre-<em>Qin</em> emphasizes the period before 221 BC, while the AD emphasizes the period after 1 AD.</div>

	<div p="1">However, due to the defects of the Chinese documents, the pre-<em>Qin</em> classification method cannot be actually applied in its document categorization. Many documents considered to be written after <em>Qin</em> (221BC) are similar and closely related to the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents. Hence, when studying the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents, some scholars also include documents written in the <em>Han</em> dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), and they call them the documents of pre-<em>Qin</em> and <em>Han</em>.</div>

	<div p="1">A typical example can be seen in Chinese Text Project (ctext.org), organized and maintained by Dr. Donald Sturgeon. This method expands the pre-<em>Qin</em> document date range for about four-hundred years from the year before 221 BC to 220 AD. Noticing that the middle point between 221 BC and 220 AD is the Common Era, while maintaining the Chinese traditional dynasty classification method, this paper also applied the Christian era classification in the research with plus and minus two-hundred years as the range of deviation.</div>

	<ol type="a">
	</ol>

	<div li="a"><a>a.</a> Family-Based Classification.</div>

	<div p="1">Family-based classification is to assign a document to a specific family. The family, also called the school, is a group of people who share some common views. Each family usually has a founder that people could follow. Hence, the family-based classification is a people-oriented classification method. For example, <em>KongZi</em> (Confucius) and <em>MengZi</em> (Mencius) are consistent in teaching, so they are classified into <em>Ru</em> family or school, <em>KongZi</em> is considered as the founder of <em>Ru</em> family; <em>LaoZi</em> and <em>ZhuangZi</em> are similar, they are grouped to a family of Dao. <em>LaoZi</em> is considered as the founder of the Dao family.</div>

	<div p="1">Family-based classification is the Chinese traditional and oldest classification method in China. It can be found in pre-<em>Qin</em> documents. For example, the book of 荀子 XunZi contains criticism about the plagiarism in <em>Ru</em> family. But how and why the family-based classification started is still unknown. The only thing that is known is that the family-based people-oriented classification is an important feature of the pre-<em>Qin</em> culture. For over two thousand following years, almost no new family or school appeared in history until now.</div>

	<div p="1">A critical issue in people-oriented classification is that the definition of the school or family cannot be clearly defined. For example, today, the term <em>Ru</em> family is usually defined as a system of philosophical and ethical teachings or thoughts founded by <em>KongZi</em> and his followers. But what the <em>Ru</em> family exactly teaches is still arguable and uncertain. Even the meaning of the character of <em>Ru</em> is not clear. Run cannot be found in the bronzes artifacts or oracle bones. The first Chinese dictionary (Shuowen jiezi 說文解字), dated back to first century AD, says, &quot;Ru means gentle and is how men of techniques are called. (儒, 柔也术士之称)&quot; The scholar Liang Cai pointed out that <a q="" title="p1">&quot;...&quot;</a> <sup title="LiangCai2015article">[]</sup> Liang Cai pointed out that it is a puzzle in history that people turn to focus on the study of the <em>Ru</em> family (or Confucianism).</div>

	<div p="1">In spite of the defect of the people-oriented classification, there is no better way to this day to well organized the pre-<em>Qin</em> document. How to biblically classify the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents will be a challenging work that missionaries need to do in the future. At the moment, this paper will follow the existing people-oriented classification.</div>

	<div li="b"><a>b.</a> Academic Discipline-based Classification</div>

	<div p="1">Content-based classification is to assign a document to a specific subject, topic or an area of discipline according to its content. (e.g, history, medicine, military, etc). The content-based classification is an object-oriented method; it is more explicit and less arguable than the family-based classification.</div>

	<ol type="a">
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div p="1">In summary, about one-hundred-fifty documents are selected in the research; about fifty of them are considered as pre-<em>Qin</em> documents. All selected documents are leveraged with the time series classification and the content or family-based categorization. A category-periodic table is created for analysis. It is through such a platform that the features of the word can be extracted and exposed to readers.</div>

<div p="1">For example, the number of books with its title or name that contain <em>Zi</em> 子 is shown in <a title="#Table-4">Table-4</a>. From the table, it can be found that the number of books in the <em>Ru</em> family in the pre-China period is much more than others. In order to make it comparable with others, the rate of the book with <em>Zi</em> 子 is used. The result can be seen in <a title="#Table-5">Table-5.</a></div>

<h3 chapter="I" pagesize="1"><a chpnum="" id="uid14" name="uid15">IV.</a> Extraction of Features of &quot;Son&quot;</h3>

<section>
<div p="1">In this paper, feature extraction means to abstract the meanings from the results of the computed large number of documents and texts and to identify the useful information or features that can distinguish itself from others. This process includes the visual analysis of the output image, like the frequency-spectrum graphics.</div>

<div subpagesize="0.5"><a id="uid16" name="uid16" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Features of &quot;Son&quot; in the Chinese Documents</div>

<div p="1"><a>1.</a> Wide-Range of Documents</div>

<div p="1">Among one-hundred fifty collections, there is only one document that does not contain the word <em>Zi</em> 子. The name of the book is <em>HaiDaoSuanJing</em> that belongs to the category of mathematics. It makes sense that this book does not have <em>Zi</em>, since the book has nothing to do with &quot;son&quot; and its length is relatively short. However, all other various types of documents have the word <em>Zi</em> 子 (son), approximately 99.3%. The broad usage of <em>Zi</em> 子 in various books is the evidence of the importance of the <em>Zi</em> 子 (son) in pre-China writings. The frequency-spectrum of this book can be seen in Figure-3. For simplification, this document will be excluded in the further frequency-spectrum analysis.</div>

<div p="0.5"><a id="uid17" name="uid17" subpage_idx="">2.</a> Top-Frequency Words Distribution among Documents</div>

<div p="1">There are two documents to show that the frequency of <em>Zi</em> is &quot;unreasonably&quot; high and ranked among the top of distinct words: the book of <em>LunYu</em> and <em>SanZiJing</em>. Both of them belong to <em>Ru</em> family. The book of <em>LunYu</em> is an important book in <em>Ru</em> family, which is about morality, politics and philosophy, etc. <em>SanZiJing</em> is a rhythm teaching book for students. For frequency-spectrum see <a title="#Figure-1">Figure-1</a> and <a title="#Figure-2">Figure-2.</a></div>

<div p="1">For other documents, the top ranked characters are: 之 x97, 也 x12, 的 x8, 不 x7, 了 x4, 曰 x3, 者 x3, 十 x2, 有 x2, 于 x1, 从 x1, 以 x1, 兮 x1, 其 x1, 年 x1, 惟 x1, 水 x1, 道 x1, 阴 x1. 韵 x1. All of these are grammatical words except 水 x1, means &quot;water,&quot; is consistent with the content of the book of ShuiJingZhu 水经注 about rivers. and 曰 x3, 道 x1, means &#39;speak&#39;, widely used in fiction.</div>

<div p="0.5"><a id="uid18" name="uid18" subpage_idx="">3.</a> Frequency-Spectrum Distinction of Documents</div>

<div p="1">By the survey of all frequency-spectrum, it is found that there are about fifty documents, one-third of the selected, the rank of <em>Zi</em> is in the top ten. About eighty documents, roughly half of the collection, the rank of <em>Zi</em> is in the top twenty. Figure-4 shows a spectrum of the rank of <em>Zi</em> in the collection of the documents. This figure is consistent with the frequency of <em>Zi</em> in the spectrum over the selected documents. (See Figure-5). These two figures show that the frequency of character <em>Zi</em> is relatively stable between the lowest and highest.</div>

<div p="0.5"><a id="uid19" name="uid19" subpage_idx="">4.</a> <em>Ru</em>-Family and Historical Documents</div>

<div p="1">A categorized frequency-spectrum (Figure-6) shows that <em>Ru</em> family (in red color) have higher frequency usage of <em>Zi</em> than others. The second one is the historical books. The similarity of the frequency-spectrum of <em>Zi</em> in <em>Ru</em> and in the historical books show that they have something in common about the character <em>Zi</em>&mdash;the core value of Chinese culture is <em>Ru</em>.</div>

<div p="0.5"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">5.</a> Common Era Distribution</div>

<div p="1">The changes of the frequency-spectrum according to the simplified Chinese dynasty based periodic classification can be seen in Figure-7. The figure shows that the usage of <em>Zi</em> 子 experienced two dramatic drops, one in <em>QinHan</em>, and on is in post-Modern writings. From the view of the Common Era, there exists a sharp drop between BC and AD period. (see Figure-8) as compared with other characters changes in history, for example, Zhi 之 in Figure-9 and Figure-10.</div>

<div p="0.3"><a id="uid21" name="uid21" subpage_idx="">6.</a> Frequency-Spectrum of Suffixes for Common Era</div>

<div p="1">The top twenty highest frequency words immediately used after word <em>Zi</em> 子 are listed below according to the periodic of Common Era :</div>

<p type="my_ul"><a>BC: 曰之不以也为胥墨贡对产者孙而路有谓何使言</a><br />
<a>AD: 曰之善不孙也言为牙所以等者吼云有名路是一</a></p>

<div p="1">It can be found from the list that there is no significant differences in usage between BC and AD. A common meaningful word follows <em>Zi</em> 子 is <em>Yue</em> 曰, which means speak, talk, say and utter. It can be concluded that <em>Zi</em> 子 is frequently inferred as a speaker/talker.</div>

<div p="1"><a id="uid22" name="uid22" subpage_idx="">7.</a> Frequency-Spectrum of Prefixes for Common Era</div>

<div p="1">The top twenty highest frequency words immediately used before word <em>Zi</em> 子 are listed below according to the periodic of Common Era :</div>

<p type="my_ul"><a>BC: 君天孔公太夫晏墨之其王楚文管孟二吾弟父宣</a><br />
<a>AD:男弟天太师利种童君孔佛王儿妻之孟其夫庄老</a></p>

<div p="1">The words in BC can be classified into three groups as follows. The group (C) is a set of grammatical words with no meaning. The group (B) is a list of people&#39;s names, including the well-known <em>Kong</em> 孔 (Confucius), Mo (Moist), <em>Meng</em> 孟 (Mencius), Moism 墨, etc.</div>

<p type="my_ul"><a>(A) 君天公太夫王弟父</a><br />
<a>(B) 孔晏墨楚文管孟宣</a><br />
<a>(C) 之其二吾</a></p>

<div p="1">The group (A) is a set of meaningful words that can be translated into English (see list below). Among them, seven words have a close relationship with each other. Some of them are mutually exchangeable in meaning, and sometimes they appear in the scripture with a pair. For example, 君王 and 天王 both mean &quot;king.&quot; Among the seven words, three of them (2, 6, 7) are relatively simple in English translation. However, the other four words (1, 3, 4, 5) are confusing in the native language, and no single English word can fully match each of them. Overall, these seven words have common sense related to glory, noble, power, divinity etc. Because these seven words can be easily connected to Isaiah 9:6-7. (See Table-10), this paper will call them the seven-wonderful-words (7WW).</div>

<p type="my_ul"><a>(1) 君 = prince, ruler</a><br />
<a>(2) 天 = heaven, sky</a><br />
<a>(3) 公 = catholic, public, justice</a><br />
<a>(4) 太 = super, extreme, eternal, highest</a><br />
<a>(5) 夫 = master, teacher, counselor</a><br />
<a>(6) 王 = king, emperor</a><br />
<a>(7) 父 = father</a><br />
<br />
<a>(8) 弟 = brother, follower, disciple.</a></p>

<div p="1">As a comparison between BC with AD, it is not hard to find that in the list of AD, 弟 (Di) is promoted to the second position from the 18th in BC. The seven wonderful words are downgraded. The words 公 (Gong) and 父 (<em>Fu</em>) are even kicked out of the top twenty from the BC list and become between three-hundred and four-hundred in the rank of the AD period. The relatively close group of seven wonderful words are disassembled and diluted by 男 = male, 童, 儿 = children, 佛 = Buddha, etc.</div>

<div subpagesize="0.5"><a id="uid17" name="uid17" subpage_idx="">2.</a> Features of &quot;Son&quot; in the Bible</div>

<div p="1">If the same method, which is used for the feature extraction of <em>Zi</em> (子, son) for the Chinese documents, is applied into the Bible to examine the features of word <em>Ben</em> (בן, son) in the Old Testament and <em>Huios</em> (&upsilon;&iota;̔ό&sigmaf;, son)in the New Testament respectively, it can be found that features of <em>Zi</em> in Chinese documents is exactly the same as the features of &quot;son&quot; in the Bible.

<div p="1">In the Chinese Union Version (CUV), except 3John, all books have the word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Zi</em> ), covering 98.4%. In the STUT Chinese version of Bible, all books have the word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Zi</em>). The coverage is 100%.</div>

<div p="1">In the Bible, from its first appearance in Gen 4:17 to the last occurrence in Rev 21:7, the word son appears throughout Scripture, from the beginning to the end in the Bible.</div>

<div p="1">The common-sense usage of the word &quot;son&quot; is abnormal in a wide-range area. However, it can be found that the word &quot;son&quot; has the same characteristics in usage both in the Bible and the pre-China documents.</div>

<div p="1">With roughly a total of 305,358 Hebrew words in the OT, the frequency of &quot;son&quot; is about 1.6% or 161.84 (pm), greater than the word of &#39;god&#39;. From this point, the OT can be considered as a son-centered book; Jewish culture can be considered as the Messiah culture.</div>

<section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid19" name="uid19" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Starting Point</div>

<div p="1">Christianity and the Chinese culture, or the Bible and the Chinese documents, are not irrelevant and independent. However, they are different and difficult to communicate with each other. The following two points are a strong rapport to demonstrate that they are inseparable and closely related despite distinct. These common grounds &quot;are the starting point of the contextualization found within the circle of faith-commitment to God&#39;s revelation in Christ.&quot;<sup pg="p58" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup></div>

<div btitle="1" p="2"><a id="uid26" name="uid26" subpage_idx="">(i)</a> Common Concept of the &quot;Son&quot;</div>

<div p="1">The Chinese character 子 (<em>Zi</em>), Hebrew word בן (<em>Ben</em>) and Greek word &upsilon;&iota;̔ό&sigmaf; (<em>Huios</em>) have a common sense of &quot;son&quot;, which means a male child of his parents, although the languages, cultures, religions, historical times and places are different. People do not argue with the evidence but tend to ignore it.</div>

<div btitle="1" p="2"><a id="uid26" name="uid26" subpage_idx="">(ii))</a> Common Pattern of the &quot;Son&quot;</div>
<!--- In about fifty pre-China documents, about 98% of them contain the word <em>Zi</em> 子, covering various kinds of topics regardless whether it is related to sonship or not. (see item 1, 2 and 3 in the previous chapter)." --->

<div p="1">(a) As discussed early, the statistic data for the usage of &quot;son&quot; is extremely similar between the Chinese documents and the Bible. The word &quot;son&quot; is widely used in many books unrelated to its story or content. In pre-China documents, about 98% of them contain the word <em>Zi</em> 子, covering various kinds of topics regardless of whether it is related to sonship or not. (see item 1, 2 and 3 in the previous chapter). Among 39 books in the OT, 89.7% of them contain <em>Ben</em> (son). Among 27 books of the NT, 92.5% of books contain <em>Huios</em> (son). (see table-9 Frequency of &quot;Son&quot; in the Bible)</div>

<div p="1">(b) The frequency of &quot;son&quot; is exceptionally high in both Chinese documents and the Bible. For example, the frequency of <em>Zi</em>(子, son) in the pre-<em>Qin</em> book of <em>LunYu</em> (论语, The Analects) ranks first among all identical characters. In the Hebrew OT, the frequency of word <em>Ben</em> (בן, son) also ranks first among all nouns, higher than the critical word <em>Elohim</em> (אלוהים, God). The frequency of word <em>Huios</em> (&upsilon;&iota;̔ό&sigmaf;, son) ranks eighth among all nouns in Greek NT.</div>

<div p="1">(c) More interesting, in general, there is a tendency that the frequency of &quot;son&quot; used in BC time period is higher than that in AD. For example, in Chinese documents, the overall frequency of <em>Zi</em>(子 son) used in BC is 131.36 (pm, per thousand), which is much higher than that in AD, 38.96 (pm). (See Table-8). In the Bible, the rank of frequency of &quot;son&quot; in the OT is higher than that in the NT. The frequency of <em>Ben</em> (son) in the OT is 1.6%, which is higher than the frequency of <em>Huios</em> (son) in the NT which is 0.27%.</div>

<div p="1">In a word, Chinese documents and the Bible share a common pattern in the usage of &quot;son&quot;. With so many complicated parameters in statistics, it is less likely that the identical pattern comes from a coincidence.</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid20" name="uid20" subpage_idx="">2.</a> Theological Meaning of Son in the Bible</div>

<div p="1">&quot;Contextualization should concern itself with &#39;relational centers.&#39; History reveals that God the Holy Spirit guides in such a way that the givens of biblical theology are applied to specific historical and cultural contexts.&quot;<sup pg="p58" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> Based on the universal concept, the word son has its own different meaning in different languages and cultures.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">(i) In the NT</div>

<div p="1">In the NT, the worldly word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Huios</em>) is specially used to express a unique relationship between Jesus Christ and God: Jesus is the only Son of God, and God the Heavenly Father of Jesus Christ. The sonship relationship between the holy Son and the holy Father is to demonstrate that Jesus fully inherited all natures of God including the almighty power, the Kingdom and the glory. From a perspective of the Word (Logos), Jesus was with God in the beginning. Jesus was God. (John 1:1)</div>

<div p="1">Meanwhile, the worldly word &quot;son&quot; (<em>Huios</em>) is also used to express the relationship between Jesus and man. Jesus called Himself the son of Man. However, Jesus did not mean that man is His parents or father. Jesus is the son of man because the Father (God) has set his seal on Him. (John 6:27) In other words, Jesus is not the real son nor stepson but the adopted son of man. Jesus has no any genetic relationship with man. He did not inherit anything sinful from man. However, it is totally legal for anyone to adopt Jesus as his own son for his heritage, expectation and hope in the afterlife. Indeed, Jesus is the only son given to man for adoption. &quot;Those who have the Son has the eternal life&quot; (1John 5:12) Human salvation is accomplished through the sonship adoption process rather than the labors or good deeds.</div>

<div p="1">On the other hand, Jesus was not &quot;willing&quot; to be the son of man. It was the heavenly Father who force Him to be the son of man. He was born in a poor family of Mary and Joseph. He never felt proud to be the son of man nor his Jewish culture nor his family on earth. Jesus never called nor admitted anyone in the world as His mother or father. (Mat 12:48) But Jesus endured accomplishing all the duty what a son should do. Moreover, Jesus was forced to inherit all flesh weakness of man. He had to endure all shames, guilties, failures, bitterness and death of man. Jesus was heavily oppressed both by God and man. From this perspective, to be the son of man means to be like a poor little child being maltreated physically and spiritually by his parents.</div>

<div p="1">In a word, the &quot;son&quot; in the Gospel not only means a male offspring of his parents, and the role of expectation and hope of his parents for afterlife, but also implies an inheritance relationship between the only Savior and the God, the only Savior and the saviee, as well as the role of the God&#39;s salvation plan. Through the word of &quot;son&quot; and the multiple sonships of Jesus Christ, the common worldly sense of &quot;son&quot; has been contextualized to refer to the savior who is Jesus Christ&mdash;the Only Son of God. &quot;Whoever has the Son has life;&quot; (1John 5:12) Obviously, in the NT, the word son has a soteriological meaning that refers to Jesus Christ.</div>

<div btitle="1" p="2"><a id="uid26" name="uid26" subpage_idx="">(ii)</a> In the OT</div>

<div p="1">In the book of Genesis, the word <em>Ben</em> (בֵּן, son) first was used with plural noun by God after the fall of man. God said to Eve that &quot;with pain you will give birth to <b>children</b> (בֵּן, sons).&quot; (Gen3:16 NIV) It is noticeable that the word daughter (בַּת) is not mentioned in pair along with son. Neither does it specify the gender of <em>Ben</em> (בֵּן, son)<em>.</em> In the biblical context, the word &quot;son&quot; originally has nothing to do with gender or sex; instead, &quot;son&quot; is associated with sin, punishment and pain that is gender non-specific.</div>

<div p="1">The first person who was actually called &quot;son&quot; is not Cain or Abel, who are the first two children of Adam and Eve. The word son began to be widely used after Cain murdered Abel. Son first is used with Enoch(Gen 4:17), then is used with Seth(Gen 4:25). Enoch is the son of the murdering criminal. (Gen 4:17) Seth is the son in replace of the killed person.(Gen 4:25) &quot;Son&quot; is associated with the meaning of renewing of life.</div>

<div p="1">Cain is the first criminal in history; he is also the first person to utilize the name of his son to protect himself. &quot;Cain was building a city, and he names the city after his son (בֵּן) Enoch&quot; (Gen 4:17) It seems to Cain that the physical castle is not enough, he also has to attach the name of his son onto the fortress to effectively protect him from punishment to gain safety and peace. It is not unreasonable for Cain to do so. Although his baby son is not strong nor is he a great figure, his son is innocent. It is intuitive for Cain to make use of the label &quot;Baby On Board&quot; to protect himself. It can be seen that the word <em>Ben</em> (&quot;son&quot;) initially has a functionality of the expectations that criminal parents could be exempt from the punishment in his life and the afterlife.</div>

<div p="1">Cain probably never knew the true reason behind the power of son. There is another person also called Enoch, the son of Jared, the offspring of Seth, the seventh grandson of Adam. &quot;Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.&quot;(Gen 5:18) Being different from Enoch the son of Cain who has nothing special, Enoch the son of Jared is famous and unique. Enoch the son of Jared can bring hope for anyone who has a son. The story of Enoch the son of Jared is the beginning of the connection between son and the auspicious sign that is earlier than the son-preference in many cultures.</div>

<div p="1">The story of cognominal Enoch implies that <em>Ben</em> (son) contains the meaning of not only the expectation of being exempt from punishment on earth, but also the hope of being saved by God. After Seth had a son, men began to call on the name of the Lord. (Gen 4:26) The concept of &quot;son&quot; and the concept of the Lord are closely related and equally important. A significant difference between them is that the name of the Lord is forbidden to misuse. (Deut 5:11) Whereas, the word son is free to use.</div>

<div p="1">Another significant difference is that the word son plays an important role in the OT to predict the advent of Jesus Christ. A typical example can be seen in the oracle of Isaiah. <span>&quot;For to us a child is born, to us a son (בֵּן) is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&quot; (Isa 9:6 ESV)</span> <span>Ultimately, the word son becomes an alternative term for Messiah in the OT.</span></div>

<div p="1">Indeed throughout the whole OT, the concept of son always directly or indirectly infer to the advent Jesus. For example, when Abraham is tested (Gen 22), his only son Isaac becomes a prefigure to imply the sacrifice of Jesus. The story of the winding path of the life of Joseph (Gen 37-50) is a foreshadow of the victory of the salvation of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div p="1">The predictive information of son not only embedded in the OT through all kinds of devices and stories, it is also hidden in the statistic data such as the high frequency of usage of the word <em>Ben</em>. In the book of 1Chronicle, the word <em>Ben</em> (son) is repeated for 163 times. It is through the repetition of the word to keep reminding readers to watch out what the Scripture implied.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">Through the hindsight, it is clear that the concept of <em>Ben</em> (&quot;son&quot;) carries a mission of God. Within the biblical context of the OT, the word of <em>Ben</em> (son) has metaphorical meaning behind its common gender-based biological definition. The word son is associated with sin, pain, as well as the expectation, hope, justice and salvation. From a soteriological perspective, <em>Ben</em> (son) always directly or indirectly refers to the Messiah throughout the OT. The word son is a prophecy term for the advent of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1"><a>(iii)</a> In Theology</div>

<div p="1">The common definition of &quot;son&quot; provides a strong rapport between the Messiah and Jesus Christ. The equalization between the Messiah and Jesus Christ is accomplished through the incarnation of the Word. Jesus said, &quot;Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.&quot; (Luke 4:20) In the NT, the soteriological meaning for son (<em>Huios</em>) is Jesus Christ; in the OT, <em>Ben</em> (son) always implies the advent of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">Why is it the son rather than daughter that is used to refer to Jesus Christ?</div>

<div p="1">The word son (בֵּן, <em>Ben</em>) first appears in a plural noun directly from the mouth of God. Although it refers to the descendant of woman, it is under a biblical situation after the fall of man during the judgment of God when the earth (אֲדָמָה) was cursed.(Gen 3:16) The meaning of the descendant or offspring is not emphasized, instead, the concept of <em>Ben</em> (son) focuses on the meaning related to the sin, curse, punishment and pain.(Gen 3:16) Further, the word son began to be used for individual only after the first crime occurred. First, it is used with the son of the murder Cain (Gen 4:17); then, it is used for Seth who is in place of the killed Abel. (Gen 4:25) The biblical context demonstrates that, in the eyes of God, the word <em>Ben</em> (son) <span>has nothing to do with gender or sex, instead, the concept of son is associated with sin, curse, punishment, pain, hope, and renew of life and so on, all of those are the concept without gender or sex.</span> In a general sense, the word son can be translated as child.</div>

<div p="1">The word daughter (בַּת) is not mentioned until after son has been used for four or five times individually. The word daughter is first used in a context to describe the offspring of Seth (Gen 5:4) and used with son in a pair. However, although in the same context, there are words of male and female (Gen 5:2), neither son nor daughter is specified with the gender. In other words, son is not associated to male; daughter is not associated to female. The concept of son and daughter is still gender non-specific.</div>

<div p="1">Seth is the third child of Adam to replace his murdered brother Abel.(Gen 4:25) The expression of sons and daughters of Seth implies that the sons and daughters are the offspring of the replacement of the killed person. The primitive root of the word <em>Ben</em> (son) has a meaning to build, rebuild, establish, cause to continue. The primitive root of Buth (daughter) comes from <em>Ben</em>. Just like the relationship between Adam and Eve, and like male and female God created, son and daughter carries the meaning of the recreation of God after death.

<div>Since son already has the meaning of offspring of the sin (Gen 3:16). As an additional word to express the meaning of descendant, the information of the offspring of the killed person naturally falls on the word of daughter and becomes a key nature to distinct itself from son. Also, since the concept of son contains the meaning of hope and has roles of prediction of Jesus Christ in the OT. Thereafter, if son is considered relating to the protector and savior, then daughter would be related to the protectee and saviee. Initially, the distinction between the pair of son and daughter is not based on gender or sex, but based on the soteriological roles in the concept of salvation of God.</div>
</div>

<div note="There is no any city is named after the name of daughter." p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div p="1">As far as the duty of filial piety for parents and the mission of God, son and daughter have no difference. But regarding the role and functionality, they differ significantly. Only the son has the legal right to succeed the house-head position of his father. To accomplish the legal duty, when son grows up, he has to become a bridegroom to bring the bride into the family to fulfill the mission of marriage. &quot;the bride belongs to the bridegroom.&quot; (John 3:29) While He was a son of man on earth, Jesus wanted to be a bridegroom. Jesus answered, &ldquo;How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.&quot; (Mark 2:19-20) From a missiological viewpoint, son represent the missionary and daughter represents the lost one.</div>

<div p="">According to the Parable of the Great Wedding Feast (Mat 22:1-14, Luke 14:15&ndash;24), the Son of God is the bridegroom, the union of saviees is His bride. In the eyes of Jesus, the most beautiful bride is not based on the gender but based on the heart of the love of Him. The salvation is accomplished through the marriage between the Son of God and the children of God. This could explain why polygamy was illegal but permitted in the royal family in the OT time. It is not only &quot;because of the hardness of your heart&quot; (Mat 19:8), but also because of that, indirectly, it could be a shadow of the advent of salvation in the Heaven. Indeed, in the heaven, people will not be bothered by sexual desires, &quot;At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they be like the angels in heaven&quot; (Mat 22:30) On the earth, the role of sex is designated to maintain the existing of the race on earth due to the death of individuals. The sexual desire could be a power stronger than the will of man. The sexually driven marriage on earth is used to imply the salvation and the love of God in heaven. But from a missiological viewpoint, son represents the active lover and daughter represents the passive beloved.</div>

<div btitle="1" p="1" refer1="">Why is God called the Father rather than the Mother?</div>

<div p="1">The word father (אָב) and mother (אֵם) first appear before the fall of man, after Eve is created from a rib of Adam, and within the context of the pair of a man (אִישׁ) and a wife (אִשָּׁה). (Gen 2:24) Originally, father and mother contain the meaning of a perfect family within four basic members.</div>

<div p="1">Eve originally is called &quot;woman&quot; by both God (Gen 2:22) and Adam (Gen 2:23). The context clearly shows that &quot;woman&quot; has two meanings before the fall of man: a) the helper of Adam (Gen 2:18) b) the part of Adam.(Gen 2:21) The primitive root word of woman (אִשָּׁה) is man ( אִישׁ ).The primitive root of man ( אִישׁ ) means to be weak, sick, frail. Initially, the difference between the woman and man is not determined by gender or sex but by its role and origin.</div>

<div p="1">The feature of gender first is exposed on woman after the fall of man during the judgment of God. &quot;Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception (הֵרָיוֹן); in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.&quot; (Gen3:16 KJV) For the first time, it shows that woman is different from man because woman contains the concept of conception (הֵרָיוֹן), born and pain and sin.</div>

<div p="1">In spite that the meaning and father and mother are not given in the immediate context, from the mirror of Adam and Eve, it can be concluded that father is like Adam or man, and mother is like woman. A clear role of father is not demonstrated until after the fall of man: the one who first began to live in a tent and raise cattle (Gen 4:20) and the one who first began to play the harp and flute (Gen 4:21) are entitled as &quot;father.&quot; In other word, father has the meaning of originator, creator and inventor.</div>

<div p="1">Originally, Eve is called woman by God (Gen 2:22). Before the fall of mankind, Adam also calls his helper as woman.(Gen 2:23). During the story of the fall of mankind, she is always called as woman. But after the fall of man and the judgment of God, Adam gives his woman a name Eve. (Gen 3:20) Eve means the Mother of all the living. (Gen 3:20) After Eve born the first child Cain (Gen 4:1), the name of Eve is not used any more in the OT. Cain becomes a murder lately. Although the name of Eve only appears twice in the OT, since then, human beings began to have a Mother.</div>

<div p="1">However, Adam did not call himself as the Father of all living. Hence, human beings did not have a Father until Jesus came into the world to call the Lord the heavenly Father. Only Jesus had the right to call the Lord the heavenly Father. Because in the eyes of the Son of man, the relationship between the Father and the Mother is not based on the gender nor sex but based on the Holy Spirit, the sovereignty, holiness and glory, based on the relationship between the creator and the createe, the lover and the lovee. The Father and the Mother are not in the same domain for equal rights. Only the heavenly Father is what human beings should worship and glorify.</div>

<div p="1">From a missiological view point, the four-members family is the mirror of the basic organization of church. Father and mother represent the missionaries, elders and leaders; man and woman represent the community and followers. The relationship between father and mother or man and woman is like the relationship between Jesus and His people. The purpose of family is originally designed for the advent missionary. The filial piety in the ten commandments is actually from the missiological purpose.</div>

<div p="1">After the fall of man, son and daughter, brother and sister are introduced into the family and are separated out from man and woman. They mirror the advent church community in OT and become clear in NT. After Jesus fufiled His mission through redemption, with His multiple sonships, the son of man and the only Son of the Heavenly Father, all sons and daughters of the Mother can return back to be the children of God.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div btitle="" p="1" refer1="https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-qa/god-and-man-as-male-and-female-implications-for-gender-identity/">Why did God create male and female (Gen 1:27)?</div>

<div p="">Human beings classify themself into various types according to color, ethnicity, culture, nationality, age, education, social status, gender or sex, etc. But God initially only created two types of man according to His image and likeness: male and female. Human beings identify males and females based on gender or sex. For example, they identify a newborn baby primarily based on its sex organ. However, in the OT, there is no such word &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;gender&quot; in Hebrew. In the KJV, the closest meaning for &quot;gender&quot; is <em>raba</em> (רָבַע) in Hebrew, which means: to lie stretched out, lie down. (Lev 18:23, 19:19, 20:16)</div>

<div p="">According to what God said initially, &quot;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and overall the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&quot; (Gen 1:26) Man has no property of gender or sex. The image of God has no gender. Regarding the duties assigned to man, gender or sex is not necessary at all.</div>

<div p="1">However, according to what God did, &quot;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created them.&quot; (Gen 1:27) The word male and female suddenly appeared during the creation. Moreover, in Hebrew, the word male (זָכָר) and female (נְקֵבָה) are completely different and they have no any common ground at all. The word male (זָכָר) comes from a primitive root (זָכַר) that means &quot;to remember, recall, call to mind&quot; . The female (נְקֵבָה) comes from a primitive root (נָקַב) that means &quot;to pierce, perforate, bore, appoint; to curse, blaspheme.&quot;</div>

<div p="">It seems that what God said is different from what God did. However, this does not mean that God rebels against Himself. God is faithful God. (Duet 7:9) &quot;I will not alter the word that went forth from my lips&quot; (Psa 89:34) &quot;As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.&quot;(Isaiah 55:10-11) The difference between the saying and doing only means that the creation of man is finished, but ultimate goal of the creation is yet accomplished.</div>

<div p="">Based on what God said after He created man, it can be seen that the primary purpose to create male and female is to &quot;Be fruitfule and increase in number; fill the earth&quot; (Gen 1:28) Today human beings think that being fruitful and increasing in number is related to gender and sex. However, in the eyes of God, man are genderless or sex-free. God never said that Adam(אָדָם) is male and Eve (חַוָּה) is female. God called Eve as woman (אִשָּׁה). The word woman (אִשָּׁה) comes from the primitive root word man (אִישׁ), which means &quot;part of man.&quot; Eve is originally called woman. The name of Eve was given by Adam after the fall of man. The word man and woman, the male and female are two pairs of words. But man and male, woman and female are not connected in Hebrew until the circumcision appears (Gen 17:10)</div>

<div p="">The absence of sex in the Hebrew context indicated that the male and female are not determined by sex or gender. The purpose to create male and female is not to create two kinds of human beings based on the gender or sex. In the eyes of God, males and females are one humankind. The distinction between the male and female is the seal of God set on humankind to prepare for human beings to be able to distinguish between son and daughter, the savior and saviee.</div>

<div p="">From this perspective, it can be seen that, what God said to man (Gen 1:28) is exactly the same as what Jesus said to His disciples.(Mat 28:19-20) (a) &quot;God bless them (man)&quot; refers to &quot;Surely I(Jesus) will be with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot; (b) &quot;be fruitful&quot; means &quot;make disciples&quot;, (c) &quot;increase in number and fill the earth&quot; means &quot;throughout all nations and baptizing (fill) them in name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot;, (d) &quot;subdue and rule over&quot; means &quot;teach them to obey everything I (Jesus) have commanded you.&quot; Jesus&#39; Great Commission is not something new but the command of God when man was created in the beginning. The distinction between male and female is the distinction between son and daughter, the Son and man, the disciples and the Gentiles. In the eyes of God, human beings have only two kinds: Christian and non-Christian, like sheep and goat (Mat 25:32)</div>

<div p="1">In a word, male and female are not the trouble makers leading to adultery or pain; instead, God created male and female to prepare for the Son of God to fulfill the salvation plan.</div>

<div btitle="" p="1">Why is Jesus the Son of the Father?</div>

<div p="1">
<div>As it is the created beings and it is filled with sin, it is hard for mankind to believe in Jesus Christ--the super-center of the universe. It has to be a progressive process under the revelation of God from the OT to the NT, first, to know the concept of human son, then to trace up to the heavenly Father and finally to be able to perceive the Holy Spirit. However, to better understand the Son of God, it would have to discuss it through a way of the Trinity.</div>

<div>As the number of generations is getting more and more, it&#39;s getting harder and harder to trace back the ancestors; people who know ancestors becomes less and less. Accordingly the innate capability of knowing God is getting weaker and weaker until it was totally lost when Jesus came. The simple relationship between the Son and the Father is a shortcut for the long and broken lineage from the individual, to parents, to grandparents, to all ancestors, to Adam, and to God.</div>

<div>Jesus is a son of man. Not all people love their parents, but all people love children even they rebel. (Mat 7:9-10) In many cultures such as China and India, to have a child, especially a boy, is considered as auspicious sign in family life. Usually, people prefer children over their parents. Children are the hope and future of parents. As long as children have a bright future, parents would not concern their bitterness and desperation and death. Abraham&#39;s top desire from God is to have a boy. Parents could get proud if their children are extraordinary. These human natures make it easy for man to allow Jesus to come into life. Jesus is a son man. Everyone can have Jesus since He is the Son of man to allow freely to adopt. As a son of man, Jesus will never make those who adopt him disappointed. The story of Jesus is the story of the son of man. Everyone who has Jesus has everything&mdash;the glory of the Father, the love of God, the hope of future, the eternal life. &quot;Whoever has the Son has the eternal life; whoever does not have the Son does not have the eternal life&quot; (1John 5:12)</div>

<div>Not all people can experience the parenthood, but all can experience childhood. The son of man is a purified paradigm that has all nature of all children. Jesus can be understood by all people without high level of education. Jesus is not a superman who merely makes people admirable. He is the one that everyone can follow him. Jesus is weaker and poorer than all children. &quot;A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,&quot; (Mat12:20 NIV) Everyone can follow Him as long as he is willing.</div>

<div>Jesus is not only the son of man but also the Son of God. He has all properties of both the children and the son of Father. Since the Son of God inherits all properties from God, hence, Jesus also has all properties both children and God. Everyone who follows Him can reach God. Man can only reach God through Him. God can only save man through Him. God&#39;s redemption plan can only be fulfilled through Him. Jesus said, &quot;No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; (Jhn14:6 ESV)</div>

<div>In theory, son and father are two completely separated concepts, but in reality, a son and a father cannot be divided at anytime at all. &quot;The Father would not be Father unless he had a Son, and the Son would not be Son unless he has a Father.&quot;<sup pg="66" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> &quot;He was with God in the beginning.&quot; (Jhn1:2 NIV) When a person can switch focus from a worldly son to Jesus Christ, he is able to see the heavenly Father. Jesus said, &quot;Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.&quot; (Jhn14:9 ESV) If a person did not know Jesus, he could not know the Father. Jesus said, &quot;You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&quot; (Jhn 8:19 ESV) Between the Son and the Father, it is much easier for human beings to understand a son than God. As the human lineage is getting longer and longer, the capability to know God is weaker and weaker until totally lost. As a matter of fact, human beings cannot see or understand God directly at all because He is holy.</div>

<div>To have Jesus as the son of man is not to be the father of the son. Instead, to have the son of man is to learn from the son and to return back to be like a son and to follow the spirit of the son. Following needs a correct direction. To follow the son of man is not to imitate the childish enthusiasm, a childish outburst, naive temper, looks or behaviors but about the Holy Spirit. Children need to grow up not just physically in body, but more essentially in spirit to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Jesus said: &quot;I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (Mat18:3 NIV) What Jesus implied is about the properties of children who are the poor spirit, those who mourn, the meek, hunger and thirst not for the bread and milk but for the righteousness, who are merciful, pure in heart, the peacemakers, malstreated because of the righteousness. (Mat 5:1-10)</div>

<div>A difference between the Son and the Father is that the Son inherits the Father rather than that the Father inherits the Son. &quot;The Son is the Son because he is begotten from the Father and proceeds from the Father by way of generation.&quot; <sup pg="65" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> &quot;The Father is the Father because he is the unbegotten&quot;<sup pg="54" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> The Son is the son of the Father, he is not the son of the Holy Spirit; the Father is the father of the Son, he is not the father of the Holy Spirit. However, both the Son and the Father share the same Holy Spirit. The Son and the Father are idential in that the Son inherits everything from the Father in the Holy Spirit.</div>

<div>On the basis of an understanding of human begetting, analogous content can be derived in applying the term &#39;generation&#39; <sup pg="65" title="ThomasGWeinandy1995book">[]</sup> It seems in the world that the Son is the next generation of the Father. The Father is the first, the Son is the second. It is in compliance with the relationship between man and the Lord, the createe and the creator. However, in the kingdom of heaven, there is no time, no history, no space, no logic, no grammatical tense(past, present and future). Jesus said, &quot;Heaven and earth will pass away,&quot; (Mak13:31 NIV) &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot; (Rev22:13 ESV) &quot;But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.&quot; (Mat19:30 NIV) The Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end, are all in one.</div>

<div>If the Son&#39;s Holy Spirit is considered as the only Way for man to seek God, then the Father&#39;s Holy Spirit is the ultimate destination that is the perpetual Truth. The bondage between the Son&#39;s Father and the Father&#39;s Son, which is the love(agape) of God, is essentially the deployed eternal life. Jesus said that &quot;I am the Way, the Truth and the Life&quot; (John 14:6) What Jesus said about the Way, the Truth and the Life is essentially the same as the trinity (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit) but in a a human understandable expression. Unless to intoduce the concept of trinity, otherwise, Jesus, the Son of the heavenly Father, cannot be well articulated and understood.</div>

<div>From a perspective of a state, if the only Way of man in the world is considered as the Liberty, the truth that man seek is the happiness, then what the Son and the Father bring about is the everlasting human life. This leads to the United States Decaration of Independence (1776): &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evidece, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&mdash;that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...&quot;</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid21" name="uid21" subpage_idx="">3.</a> Meaning of <em>Zi</em> (son) in Chinese Documents</div>

<div p="1">
<div btitle="1">(i) The basic meaning of <em>Zi</em> (子 son) in China</div>

<div>Throughout Chinese history, there is no any argument that <em>Zi</em> (子 son) means the male child of the parents or the male offspring. Another word that has the same meaning as <em>Zi</em> is <em>Er</em> (兒, 儿). A major difference between the two is that <em>Zi</em> (子) is more formal than <em>Er</em> (儿). The two characters can be used together as ErZi (儿子).</div>

<div>The female child of parents, the female offspring, the daughter, or woman all are called Nv (女). The phrase <em>Nv-Zi</em> (女子) has the same meaning as Nv(女) but in a more formal style. The phrase <em>Nv-Er</em> (女儿) always refers to daughter. The phrase <em>Er-Nv</em> (儿女) always refers to children including both boy and daughter.</div>

<div>The word &quot;father&quot; in Chinese is <em>Fu</em> (父), &quot;mother&quot; is Mu (母). The combination <em>Fu</em>-<em>Zi</em> (父子) means father and son, Mu-<em>Zi</em> (母子) means mother and son. <em>Fu</em>-Nv (父女) means father and daughter; Mu-Nv (母女) means mother and daughter.</div>

<div>The word &quot;brother&quot; in Chinese is Di (弟). The word &quot;sister&quot; is <em>Zi</em> (姊) or Mei (妹). Di-<em>Zi</em> (弟子) or <em>Zi</em>-Di (子弟) means brother. Mei-<em>Zi</em> (妹子) refers to &quot;sister&quot;.</div>

<div btitle="1">(ii) Mystery of <em>Zi</em> (子 son) in China</div>

<div>The usage of <em>Zi</em> (子 son) in Chinese documents is very special. First, it is seldomly used with the word for kinship relationships such as father, mother, brother, or sister. Instead, it is frequently used with words to express politically and philosophically contents. For example, it is used with Tian (天 sky, heaven) or Wang (王 king, emperor) such as <em>TianZi</em> 天子 and <em>WangZi</em> 王子.</div>

<div>Second, the frequency of (子 son) is higher than the words of &quot;god&quot;. All cultures exist a concept for &quot;god&quot; in their scripts, although the connotation may be different. In Hinduism, the word &quot;god&quot; in India is &quot;parameshvar&quot; (परमेश्वर). In Muslim, the word &quot;god&quot; in Arab is Allah (الله&lrm;). In the NT, the word &quot;God&quot; in Greek is theos (&theta;&epsilon;ό&sigmaf;). In the OT, the Hebrew word &quot;God&quot; is expressed as: Elohim (אֱלֹהִים), YHWY (יהוה), Adonai(אֲדֹנָי), etc.</div>

<div>In pre-China documents, the concept of &quot;god&quot; is expressed as <em>Shen</em> (神), <em>Tian</em> (天), <em>ShangDi</em> (帝). In post-<em>Han</em> documents, it is often expressed as <em>ShangTian</em>(上天), <em>ShangZhu</em>(上主), <em>ShangDi</em> (上帝), <em>TianZhu</em> (天主). The word <em>Shang</em>(上) means &quot;up, upper, above or top&quot;.</div>

<div>In Chinese documents, especially in pre-China documents, the frequency of <em>Zi</em> (子 son) is much higher than the word of god. It brings a dilemma for many scholars about the faith of Chinese: is it the atheism or monotheism?</div>

<div>Third, in pre-China documents, there are seven wonderful words associated with the name &quot;son&quot; to formulate a group of seven wonderful sons. (See Table-10, 11) These seven sons are abnormal for common sense. How can a son be related to heaven, justice, master, mighty, etc? Chinese documents are abundant, but none of them can explain it clearly in history. For a long time, in tradition, these words are associated with rulers, emperorship or royal family. Because to study these words may offend the rulers, no scholars dare to study the word &quot;son&quot; and hence it became a mystery for today. Even today, the son-related phrases, such as <em>TianZi</em> 天子 and <em>WangZi</em> 王子, are still politically sensitive words related to rulers or the government. The phrase <em>TaiZi</em> 太子 and <em>GongZi</em> 公子 refer to the children of the rulers such as the upper level royal or rich and red communist family. <em>FuZi</em> 夫子 refers to old teachers or odd scholars. <em>FuZi</em> 父子 is still used in the family. Only <em>JunZi</em> 君子 still remains a positive meaning as a respected righteous gentleman. In a word, the seven sons in pre-China scripture are unusual. Although the meaning of &quot;Zi&quot; is still a myth for today in China, it is clear that <em>Zi</em> contains another metaphorical meaning that is related to something in heaven.</div>

<div>Fourth, as compared with the name of seven sons and the pattern of the titles of the sages, such as <em>Kong</em>-<em>Zi</em> 孔子 (Confucius), <em>Meng</em>-<em>Zi</em> 孟子 (Mencius), <em>Lao</em>-<em>Zi</em> 老子 (Daoism) and so on, it can be found that they share the same pattern of x-<em>Zi</em> (x-子). The identical grammatical form indicates that the family names, such as <em>Kong</em> 孔, <em>Meng</em> 孟, and <em>Lao</em> 老 are parallel to the seven wonderful words (君:gentleman, 天:heaven, 公:justice, 太:eternal, 夫:master, 王:king, 父:father). Such connection infers that the family names become to be respected due to the relationship with the seven sons. The conclusion is consistent to the study of the Chinese scholars that the &quot;son&quot; has the meaning of &#39;god&#39;, &#39;diviner&#39;, &#39;royal&#39; and &#39;noble&#39; in pre-China documents. (see Introduction in chapter I)</div>

<div>Fifth, in Chinese documents, the frequency of <em>Zi</em> (子 son) used in BC time is higher than the frequency in AD. Especially, the frequency of <em>Zi</em> used with the seven-wonderful-words in pre-China before 221 BC is much higher than those in post-<em>Han</em> after 220 AD. What causes the changes in China is still unknown today.</div>

<div btitle="1">(iii) The ambiguity in Chinese Culture</div>

<div>Chinese mystery about <em>Zi</em> (子 son) cannot be solved inside of Chinese culture. This is because Chinese documents are ambiguous, though its quantity is great. Hence, its thoughts and worldview are ambiguous. Without the cultures outside China, it is impossible to find out the metaphorical hidden meaning of <em>Zi</em> (子 son) in China.</div>

<div btitle="b"><a>a).</a> No Canonized Books in China</div>

<div p="1">Pre-China Scripture is a Fuzzy Set of Documents. First, in theory, the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents refer to all documents that were written before 221 BC. However, in real life, due to the poor quality of pre-<em>Qin</em> documents, the date of the existing documents cannot be verified or confirmed. Many documents were deleted, shortened, or modified during the transmission process. Some of the existing documents were believed to be fake. The poor quality led to a single document having multiple different versions, which makes it more difficult for dating.</div>

<div p="1">Second, in history, there is no consensus agreement about the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents list. Because the quality of some post-<em>Qin</em> documents is better than pre-<em>Qin</em>, many scholars would include those together in the pre-<em>Qin</em> study. For example, <em>ShiJi</em> 史记, written in the first century BC, is considered as one of the most valuable ancient documents. When study pre-<em>Qin</em>, <em>ShiJi</em> 史记 cannot be ignored.</div>

<div p="1">Due to those reasons, the term pre-<em>Qin</em> documents is indeed a fuzzy set of documents. Anyone can define it according to his needs.</div>

<div>Some scholars consider the Four-Books-and-Five-Classics as the only &quot;canonized&quot; books in China. The term Four-Books appeared in book of Wen-Xin-Diao-Long (文心雕龍, 485-540 AD). Scholar ZhuJia (朱熹, 1130-1200) considered the four books as Lun-Yu(论语), MengZi(孟子), DaXue(大学) and Zhong-Yong(中庸).</div>

<div>Originally, the term Five-Classics comes from the Six-Classics in the book of <em>ZhuangZi</em> (369-286 BC), where the six books are poem (诗), ShangShu(书), Li-Ji(礼),Yue-Jing(乐经), Zhou-Yi(易经), Spring-Autumn (春秋). But the book <em>Yue</em>-Jing(乐经) was believed to be lost in history.</div>

<div>Although the nine books can represent the thoughts of the Confucianism, none of the book can be identified as the original books. From a bibliological viewpoint, the Four-Books-Five-Classics cannot be considered as canonized books. There is no canonized documents for any ideological or religious system in China at all.</div>

<div btitle="c"><a>b).</a> Pre-China Archaic Language is Vague</div>

<div p="1">First, archaic Chinese language has no punctuation marks, which means readers can determine that word grouping based on context. However, a different group could mean differently.</div>

<div p="1">Second, unlike Hebrew, Greek, or English, every word has rich different grammatical forms (like Inflections, conjugations) to identify the voice, mood, tense, number, and person. Chinese character has no grammatical forms&mdash;every character is a singleton. It implies that readers can freely determine the voice, mood, tense, number, and person.</div>

<div p="1">Third, Chinese is a zero-article language. There is no concept of an article for the noun. There is no difference between the definite and indefinite nouns. Whether a noun is singular or plural, specific or general, is determined by readers.</div>

<div p="1">On the one hand, these characteristics make the Chinese language easier to learn and give readers more free space for imagination. On the other hand, it is subject to cause ambiguity.</div>

<div p="1">In a word, the ambiguity is one of the most important features of pre-China documents. From the Western viewpoint, pre-China documents are full of defects and not worth studying. But for those who grew up in the Chinese culture, many took the pre-China documents as the precious treasure. As a matter of fact, poor quality and ambiguity have become the secret weapons that successfully attracted people and made pre-China documents powerful. From this point of view, Chinese pre-<em>Qin</em> Scripture is not ambiguous; rather it is crafty. <a q="1" title="p10">&quot;...&quot;</a><sup title="HolmesWelch1957Book">[]</sup>If people could fully understand the ambiguous nature of the Chinese documents, they would not conclude that <a q="1" title="intro_xvi">&quot;...&quot;</a><sup title="JoachimGentz2013Book">[]</sup> While preaching the gospel, it is necessary for missionaries to clear out any ambiguity surrounding people&#39;s heart and replace it with the clear, joyful, and powerful truth.</div>

<div btitle="a"><a>c).</a> Pre-China core value is obscure</div>

<div p="1">On the one hand, the pre-China Scripture is the foundation of the Chinese culture. They are powerful and influential in history. On the other hand, its core value is difficult to describe. Joachim Gentz once raised the questions: &quot;Is Confucianism a religion? Is it a philosophy or teaching of ethics?&quot; Nobody can clearly tell. Another example is the endless debates of Daoism. Many scholars spent their life in studying the book of <em>LaoZi</em> or <em>DaoDeJing</em>. Some of them claimed to find the secrets of the book. However, history shows that none of them escaped the scope of the words in its book, &quot;if the Dao can be defined, then it is not the Dao.&quot;</div>

<div p="1">The pre-China does not have a fixed core value. The pre-China scripture can be best described as a fuzzy set of many super elegant elements, including the concept of god, heaven, love, peace, righteousness, justice, ethic, rituals, judgment, wisdom, logos, name, and so on and on. But there is no clear central integrated point. It is the various scattered elements that shaped the Chinese culture rather than a single core value of the pre-China scripture. The core value of pre-China scripture is nothing but ambiguity. In essence, it is a mixture of truth and falsehood without providing criteria for distinguishing between them.<sup pg="p131" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> If mysticism insists that there is a permanent and unchangeable core value in it that people are not able to know; then, the core value has to be the same as the core value of the words of the Serpent in Genesis 3:1-4, which is to obfuscate the Word of the Lord. History shows that pre-China scripture is a powerful tool for rulers; Those who can master the pre-China documents can own the state and people. The central point of pre-China scripture can drift freely from one place to another.</div>

<div p="1">&nbsp;</div>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid22" name="uid22" subpage_idx="">4.</a> The Connection of Chinese &quot;Son&quot; and the Biblical &quot;Son&quot;</div>

<div p="1">Compared with the features of &quot;son&quot; between the Chinese documents and the Bible, it is not difficult to find that they exist a common pattern.</div>

<div p="1">(i) The frequency of &quot;son&quot; is very high.</div>

<div p="">(ii) The frequency of &quot;son&quot; used in BC is higher than the frequency in AD.</div>

<div p="">(iii) There exists a religious metaphorical concept in the conventional definition of &quot;son&quot;.</div>

<div p="">Through comparison, it exposed a significant issue: the concept of Chinese character <em>Zi</em>(son) has metaphysical meaning but it is unclear. However, in the Bible, the extended meaning of son is clear that the son refers to Jesus Christ in the NT, the Messiah in the OT. Whereas in Chinese documents, the extended meaning of son is mysteriously unknown and confusing. &quot;When the distinction between creation and redemption is blurred as it is in some contextualized theologies, confusion results. In the Bible, these two lines of God&#39;s activity meet in the incarnation, the death, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&quot;<sup pg="p58" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup> &quot;The ambiguity and inaccessibility of the Chinese language of the texts provides evidence and advantage to the contextualizer.&quot;<sup pg="131" title="DavidJHesselgraveandEdwardRommen2000">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">With the identical pattern found between the Chinese documents and the Bible, it is not hard to find that the mysterious empty hole about the meaning of <em>Zi</em>(子, son) in Chinese documents can be filled by the theological meaning of son in the Bible. In other words, the hidden meaning of <em>Zi</em> in pre-<em>Qin</em> documents is identical to the soteriological meaning of <em>Ben</em> in the OT. Both of <em>Zi</em> and <em>Ben</em> have implication referring to the same one, the only <em>Huios</em> who is Jesus Christ.</div>

<div p="1">A typical case that can support this suggestion is the set of the seven sacred words (君, 天, 公, 太, 夫, 王, 父) used to describe the seven sons in pre-China documents. can be correctly used to describe not only the titles of the wonderful Son prophesied in Isaiah 9:6-7 in the OT, but also the fulfilled story about Jesus Christ in the NT.</div>

<div p="1">In the NT, Jesus Christ is an unusual son who bears the dual sonship&mdash;the Son of God and the Son of man. Obviously, the worldly definition of &quot;son&quot; needs to be redefined in the dual sonship. Literally, a major difference of &quot;son&quot; used between the NT and the OT is that, the &quot;son&quot; in the OT is a predicted one, whereas, in the NT, the &quot;son&quot; has been manifested to refer to Jesus Christ. This difference can well explain the reason that the frequency of &quot;son&quot; is higher than the frequency of the word &quot;God&quot; is the OT.</div>

<div p="1">All sons described in the Bible, whether they are negative, like Cain, the first son of Adam, or positive, like Isaac, the only promised son of Abraham, they all directly or indirectly shadow or point to a coming person who is Messiah at the OT time but manifested in the NT time, who is Jesus Christ. The pattern of &quot;son of&quot; in the OT is not a tedious, meaningless repeating, but the reminders from inside of the heart again and again. In other words, the word &quot;son&quot; has a special mission&mdash;it is used to predict Jesus. Without the word &quot;son,&quot; it is impossible for the ancient prophets of Israelites to predict the advent of Jesus Christ.</div>

<div p="1">The reason that the frequency of &quot;son&quot; is lower in the NT than the OT can be explained by Jesus&#39; word &quot;For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.&quot; (Mat11:13, Luk 16:16) After John the Baptizer, the word &quot;son&quot; would not take the role of prophecy any more but be replaced by the name of Jesus Christ Himself.</div>
<!-------------------------------->

<div>&nbsp;
<div p="1">From the above analysis, it can be found that unless the power and ambiguity of the pre-China documents can be dismantled and cleaned up, unless the Chinese pre-<em>Qin</em> documents can be contextualized, Christianity cannot be fully rooted in China and the foundation of the Chinese church will still be very shaky.</div>
</div>
<!-------------------------------->

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid23" name="uid23" subpage_idx="">5.</a> Summary</div>

<div p="1">From above, it can be seen that, the statistic features of &quot;son&quot; and its changes in history are identical between the Chinese documents and the Bible: the &quot;son&quot; is widely used but with significantly changes in meanings between the BC and AD periods.</div>

<div p="1">More important, inside the feature of the unusual meaning of &quot;son,&quot; it can be easily found that the seven words (君:gentleman, 天:heaven, 公:justice, 太:eternal, 夫:master, 王:king, 父:father) used for the seven <em>Zi</em> (son,子) in the pre-China documents can correctly match up with one unique son with five different titles (government carrier, wonderful counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace) prophesied in Isaiah 9:6-7. In other words, the meanings of seven words used for the seven sons can be found in Isaiah 9:6-7 for the one unique son, they are: Government, Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty, God, Everlasting, heavenly Father, Prince, Peace, greatness, no-end, kingdom, justice, righteousness, forever, Almighty. (See Table 10). This is the most critical discovery for the possible Chinese sonship contextualization. It is through this inter-cultural connecting point that the paper can assert that the unusual &quot;son&quot; used in pre-China documents is the same unusual unique &quot;son&quot; in the Bible&mdash;the seven different sons in pre-China documents are indeed one person pointing to Jesus Christ manifested in the gospel.</div>

<div p="1">However, the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents were written before 221 BC. If &quot;son&quot; or <em>Zi</em> 子 in pre-China refers to Jesus Christ, it will raise several questions: 1) Is the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents the prophecy? Does pre-China scripture belong to the prophetic literature? 2) Where does the prophecy come, and who are the prophets in pre-China?</div>
</section>
<!-----------><!--------------------->

<h3 chapter="I" pagesize="1"><a chpnum="" id="uid27" name="uid24">VI.</a> Theory Construction</h3>

<section>
<div subpagesize="6"><a id="uid25" name="uid25" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Potential Reasonings</div>

<div p="1">The contextualization asserts that the unusual seven sons in pre-China are indeed embodied in one person and point to the advent of Jesus Christ. Given the fact that the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents were written before 221 BC, if <em>Zi</em> 子 (&quot;son&quot;) refers to Jesus Christ, it will raise several questions: 1) Is the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents prophecy? Does pre-China scripture belong to the prophetic literature? 2) Where does the prophecy come from, and who are the prophets in pre-China?</div>

<div li="A"><a>A.</a> If seven &quot;sons&quot; in pre-China documents refer to Jesus Christ; then, is pre-China scripture the prophetic literature?</div>

<div p="1"><a title="">From a</a> <a title="">canonical perspective of the</a> traditional division of the Hebrew Bible, &quot;prophetic literature is literature that attests to or grows out of (i.e., is generated by) the activity of Israel&#39;s prophets.&quot;<sup pg="p4" title="DavidPetersen2002Book">[]</sup> From this perspective, pre-China documents cannot be qualified as the prophetic literature.</div>

<div p="1">First of all, it is not because that the Chinese language is a foreign language, but because the archaic Chinese language has an innate defect that it has no grammatical tense for a verb to express past, present or future explicitly, and has no grammatical article for a noun to specify who, which, what and where precisely. For example, in Table-11, <em>Fu</em>-<em>Zi</em> 父子 may have dozens of meanings. It could mean the/a son of the/a father and or the/a fatherly son. The &quot;father&quot; and &quot;son&quot; could refer to a/the heavenly Father and a/the Son. But Chinese tradition always interprets it as father and son without any article.</div>

<div p="1">Another example, in words, <em>Zi</em>-<em>Yue</em> (子曰 Son-Speak), the verb &quot;speak&quot; can be interpreted in any tense with single or plural, like, &quot;said,&quot; &quot;says,&quot; &quot;will say,&quot; and so on. Being together with article-free for a noun, &quot;Son-Speak&quot; can be interpreted in dozens of ways. This is one of factors that causes pre-China scripture to be considered obscure.</div>

<div p="1">Chinese people are customized to such kind obscure expression and thinking. Such a kind of obscure language and worldview cannot attest to the activity of Israel&#39;s prophets.</div>

<div p="1">Second, ambiguity can lead to inaccuracy. Although pre-China scripture does not belong to prophetic literature, through the hindsight, at least, five critical messages can be drawn out from it.</div>

<div type="my_ul">
<div my_li="1">(1) What kind of son is he? (see the seven sons)</div>

<div my_li="1">(2) Who is the son? (Confucius, Mencius, Daoism, Moism, etc.)</div>

<div my_li="1">(3) Where is the son? (at native local land.)</div>

<div my_li="1">(4) When does the son come? (at the local time of pre-China in the second century BC)</div>

<div my_li="1">(5) Why is the son? (to seek a perfect virtual man, to get peace and hope)</div>
</div>

<div p="1">Although they get the wrong people at the wrong time and at the wrong place, their actions belong to prophecy attesting activity. Pre-China scripture cannot be the prophetic literature but can be considered as literature related to the prophecy or a poor or secondary prophetic literature. At a minimum, pre-China scripture contains some results of actions driven by prophecy.</div>

<div p="1">The fact that sages were entitled with the name &quot;son&quot; can be considered as a piece of strong evidence that people at that time began to look for the special predicted son. Confucius was a typical famous example. Because of his prominent philosophical words, he was wrongly recognized as the son of what they imagined. Indeed, the existing historical documents show that Mr. <em>Kong</em> never called himself as &quot;son&quot; or of <em>Ru</em> family.<sup title="LiangCai2015article">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">The discovery of multiple sons among sages demonstrated a failure of the prediction of the unique son in pre-China time. The failure could be caused by the ambiguity of the archaic Chinese language, the misunderstanding of the message in the prophecy or even the heresy inside of it. It is the disappointment of their expected sons that essentially caused the collapse of the pre-China culture.</div>

<div p="1">Many scholars thought that the event of The Burning of Books and Burying of Scholars (焚书坑儒), which occurred in <em>Qin</em> dynasty (221-206 BC), and which is mentioned in <em>ShiJi</em> 史记 in the first century BC, is the main reason for the loss of the original pre-China documents and the cessation of the sages in history. However, a single event is less likely to destroy the whole splendid pre-China documents. The reality could be the opposite&mdash;it is the fall of pre-<em>Qin</em> that led <em>Qin</em> to stand out for culture cleaning. The mixture of the seven sons with sage-sons in pre-China, and the downgrading and dilution of the seven sons in AD, more or less reflect the inner struggling and falling of the prediction. This theory can well explain why the usage of &quot;son&quot; in names suddenly disappeared, and the frequency of &quot;son&quot; dramatically dropped after the <em>Qin</em> dynasty. The historical changes of the usage of &quot;son&quot; is another evidence to show the effort had been made to seek for the predicted son.</div>

<div li="B"><a>B.</a> Where does the prophecy come from and who are the prophets?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div p="1">Based on the above analysis, the paper proposes a theory that the prophecy of the Son of God is well-known at pre-China right before the second century BC. The prophecy is likely from 1) Chinese prophets, 2) the prophecy from the OT, 3) Chinese magi, and 4) Chinese sages.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1) Chinese Prophets</p>

<div p="1">Prophet refers to an inspired teacher or proclaimer of the will of God about the advent of the Son of God, like Jeremiah in the OT. The well-known prophecy in China is likely coming from the prophets in China.</div>

<div p="1">Pastor <em>Yuan ZhiMing</em> is a typical representative who holds this viewpoint. In a discussion of his book <em>The <em>LaoZi</em> vs the Bible</em>, he stated that &quot;our trinity God is an universal God. He is the LORD of history, including China. [三位一体的上帝，是普世之神，历史之主，中国也不例外]&quot;<sup pg="" title="YuanZhiMingQandA2018webpage">[]</sup> According to pastor Yuan, our God is not only the God of Israelites, but also the God of Chinese. If God inspired the prophets in Israel, He would also inspire the prophets in China. Pastor Yuan said that &quot;Chinese Dao is the universal Logos. When God inspired the prophet Isaiah to predict the advent of Jesus Christ in Israel, God also inspired <em>LaoZi</em> to reveal the same message with another language in China.&quot;<sup pg="p16" title="YuanZhiming1997book">[]</sup></div>

<div p="1">Pastor Yuan&#39;s intention is to help more Chinese people to open their minds to hold on Jesus. But the price is that he promoted the level of the status of both the pre-China documents and the sages. The potential issue is that it will eventually lead the people to continue to love and cherish the native Chinese culture resulting in the &quot;Chinese-style-Christian.&quot; Instead of studying the Bible, they would continue to study the pre-China documents. Eventually, heresy will emerge affirming that the pre-China documents are higher and greater than the Bible, since the Bible does not have everything that pre-China scripture has. To promote the status of the pre-China documents is indeed to downgrade the status of the Bible. Theologically, it is against the &quot;sola scriptura&quot; principle.</div>

<div p="1">History has showed that pre-China scripture has never led people to Christ; instead, it misled its people to be away from the gospel, and became a stronghold against Christ. The situation of today is a piece of living evidence. Unless the gospel comes in to be the sole criteria, pre-China scripture will always be a fuzzy set of documents full of myths forever.</div>

<div p="1">The Bible never directly mentioned the Chinese people. It is less likely that God ever revealed the prophecy message to the Chinese. This is because Israelites are the people He selected for his prophecy. This is not about discrimination or unfairness, but about God&#39;s will, His plan and sovereignty. However, regarding salvation and love of God, all people are the same in eyes of God.</div>

<p>(2) Prophecy in the OT.</p>

<div p="1">The global message transmission in the world never stopped. The transmission of the ancient message is more advanced than people could imagine today. The well-known prophecy in pre-China is likely as the results of spreading the message in the OT from Israel. For example, the book of Isaiah was written in the seventh century BC; it is likely that the message of Isaiah was transmitted into became well-known in China before the second BC.</div>

<div p="1">However, if the predicting message in China came from the OT in Israel, people would not seek the advent Son in the land of China. They should seek Him in the Palestine area, just like the story of the Magi from east.(Mat 2:1) But pre-China people wrongly considered sages, such as Mr. <em>Kong</em> (Confucius), Mr. <em>Meng</em> (Mencius) and Mr. <em>Lao</em> (Daoism) as the predicted Son. Moreover, the date is at least two-hundred years earlier than Jesus was born. Obviously, the well-known predicting message in China was not the same as the prophecy of the OT. Hence, it was not likely from the OT in Israel.</div>

<div p="1">Some may argue that the original prophecy message in the OT could be mutated during the transmission process from Israel to China. The study of historical documents shows that all ancient Chinese documents more or less have been changed in history. History also shows that Chinese culture is good at reformation. Particularly, the archaic Chinese language is an obscure language. Without the Holy Spirit, it is hard for Chinese to accurately catch the essence of the prophecy from the OT in Hebrew.</div>

<div p="1">From archeological viewpoint, it is less likely that the predicting message came from Israel. So far, no unearthed inter-cultural or cross-culture evidence could be found in both China and Israel. Although there are many similarities between the two cultures, the difference is more significant. For example, during the Passover day, Jewish people take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the door-frames of the houses where they eat the lambs.(Exo 12:7) In China, in each new year, Chinese people would always have the red papers with blessing words to stick on the same places of the door-frames. Both customs are similar in meaning from the religious viewpoint. However, the date of Chinese New Year is always two or three months earlier than the Passover day. Both use different calendar system.</div>

<p>(3) Chinese Magi</p>

<div p="1">Magi is from Greek &mu;ά&gamma;&omicron;&iota;, also is called the wiseman. It is a name given by the Babylonians (Chaldeans), Medes, Persians, and others, to the wise men, teachers, priests, physicians, astrologers, seers, interpreters of dreams, augers, soothsayers, sorcerers, etc.</div>

<div p="1">Magi is different from prophet in that the prophet directly received the prophecy from God, whereas the magi can only get the oracle of God through signs of nature or through evil spirits.</div>

<div p="1">It is very likely that the well-known prediction of the advent of Jesus likely came from Chinese magi. This view can be supported by a discovery of a possible hometown of the Magi in Mat 2:1-16. Dr. Brent Landau states that &quot;The Revelation of the Magi is the only ancient Christian text that identifies the homeland of Magi is Shir&quot; Dr. Landau points out that &quot;Shir in ancient text, is sometimes identified with China.&quot;<sup pg="p119" title="BrentLandau2010book">[]</sup> Chinese herb (like incense, myrrh, etc.), acupuncture, QiGong, etc. mainly come from Chinese Dao-family. Its activities and mysticism are consistent with magi. This can underline the viewpoint that the well-known prophecy comes from local Chinese magi.</div>

<div p="1">Another difference between magi and prophet is that the prophecy from the prophets is accurate, whereas the oracle from magi is not accurate. That the magi from the east came to Jerusalem to ask the help from Herod (Mat 2:1-16), demonstrated that their message is limited and inaccurate. The information drawn from pre-China scripture showed that Chinese predicted information about the location, the date and people are all incorrect. The incorrectness can underline the view that magi are the main source for pre-China prediction.</div>

<p>(4) Chinese Sages</p>

<div p="1">Sage refers to a profoundly wise man, especially the one who is discreet, judicious and philosophical. Sage is different from prophet and magi in that sage mainly uses the mental capability rather than super-nature power.</div>

<div p="1">In the pre-China time, there are many sages, like <em>KongZi</em> (Confucius), <em>MengZi</em> (Mencius), <em>LaoZi</em> (Daoist), etc. Their teachings can be easily connected to the words of Jesus. For example, <em>LaoZi</em> states that &quot;To die but not perish is longevity&quot;(死而不亡者寿) (<em>LaoZi</em> chapter 33) These words can be linked to what Jesus said, &quot;Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.&quot;(Mathew 10:28) Because of this reason, many Chinese Christians interpret the Bible in a Chinese way. About one-third of Chinese pastors or missionaries ever quoted the words in pre-China documents in their preach or mission. However, sage&#39;s words are mainly focused on wisdom, rarely related to the prediction.</div>

<div p="1">The most frequently used verb for &quot;son&quot; is 曰 <em>Yue</em>, which means &quot;speak,&quot; &quot;talk,&quot; or &quot;say.&quot; (see item 6, chapter IV). Such characteristic is another evidence to prove the importance of the &quot;son&quot; in pre-China documents&mdash;the words of the Son are unusual and need to listen. Given the fact that the archaic Chinese language is tense-free, it can be translated as &quot;son will/would say&quot; in future or past-future tense. However, Chinese scholars always prefer to think of them in the present tense. Because they hardly interpret the whole context in a predictive way, the predicted information about the Son can be easily ignored and lost in history.</div>

<div p="1">The tension existing between the predictive information and the thinking mode in a present-tense is a driven power for the Chinese scribes to frequently modify or delete the words of the pre-China documents during the transmission and spreading in history. It is also a reason that pre-China text is difficult to understand for Chinese people&mdash;it is not because of the language but because of the predicting information. However, unless the original documents can be found, the well-known prophecy in pre-China is less likely to come from the Chinese sages or texts in pre-China time.</div>

<div p="1">Among all types of documents, the texts of <em>Ru</em> family contain more uses of word &quot;son&quot; than others. Within all periods of <em>Ru</em>&#39;s documents, the frequency of &quot;son&quot; in the BC period is higher than those in AD time. (see Figure-7) This result suggests that Ru&#39;s family was likely the beginner to spread predictive &quot;son&quot; in China. However, the result does not help to prove that the concept of the predicted Son originated from Ru&#39;s family. <em>KongZi</em>, the founder of <em>Ru</em> family, could be the first person to accept and believe the prophecy about the advent of the Son.</div>

<ol type="A">
</ol>

<div subpagesize="2"><a id="uid26" name="uid26" subpage_idx="">2.</a> Summary</div>

<div p="1">From the above analysis, it can be concluded that, although there exists a lot of close similarities between the features of the usage of the word &quot;son&quot; between the OT and the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents, these pieces of evidence are not enough to prove that pre-China documents belong to prophetic literature and the sages are prophets. However, this evidence can prove that the prophecy of the advent of Jesus Christ is well-known in pre-China times.</div>

<div p="1">The source of the prophecy of the advent of Jesus Christ is more likely from Chinese magi rather than sages. Chinese culture is a shame-based culture. The failure of the recognition of the predicted son could make them feel not only frustrated but also shameful. This could cause them to abound it or even to deny what they ever did. Because of this, &quot;son&quot; centered culture soon disappeared in history.</div>

<div p="1">In a word, due to man&#39;s sinfulness and shamefulness, the ambiguity of archaic language and craftiness of evil, information reflecting the effort to seek the predicted advent of Christ was soon lost after <em>Qin</em> in China history and became a myth for today.</div>

<div p="1">Although this theory lacks the support from the inter-cultural archeological evidence, it can be found that, unless the gospel can be introduced into pre-China documents as the sole criteria, the pre-<em>Qin</em> documents would be filled with myth, ambiguity, and uncertainty forever. Further history may help to prove that there is no other better theory that can explain the mystery of the usage in Chinese documents.</div>

<div p="1">The discovery of the Nestorian Stele in <em>XiAn</em> proves that there are lots of biblical evidence that can be found to give witness to Jesus Christ in the land of China, but they are ignored and lost. There is no archeological evidence that proves that Chinese culture is an isolated independent culture. Instead, it proves that how the Chinese had rejected or twisted the salvation message of God again and again.</div>

<div p="1">The evidence of the prophecy existing in pre-China can also help to prove that the prophecy of the advent of Jesus Christ was prevalent throughout the world right before He came. Unless the prophetic message had spread throughout the world, Jesus would not come. Likewise, unless the gospel will spread over to the end of the world, the end of the day will not come.</div>
<!--- file:///Users/weiding/Sites/weidroot/weidroot_2017-01-06/app/github/wdingbox/ham12/utility/htmf/sonship/SonFreq.htm -->

<div p="1">The paper shows that, to study the metaphorical statements related to <em>Zi</em> is important in the pre-<em>Qin</em> study. Unless &quot;son&quot; can be interpreted as prophetic portraits of the coming Christ, any other discussion is void or helpless to solve the myth in pre-China documents, no matter how attractive and deep the philosophies can be drawn from in it.</div>

<h3 chapter="I" pagesize="1"><a chpnum="" id="uid30" name="uid27">VII.</a> Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>

<section>
<div subpagesize="6"><a id="uid28" name="uid28" subpage_idx="">1.</a> Conclusions</div>

<div li="A"><a>A.</a> The Importance of the pre-China Documents</div>

<div p="1">Any missionary who serves in the Chinese community, or any Christian scholar who wants to study the Chinese culture, needs to know that the pre-China scripture is the foundation of Chinese culture and has a powerful lifeforce. All rulers depend on it to exercise authority over their people&#39;s souls.</div>

<div p="1">The Chinese history has shown that the pre-China scripture has strong syncretistic and adaptive capability. When facing the impact of different thoughts, religions, and cultures, such as Marxism, Buddhism, and Mongolian, the pre-China scripture can always successfully tell its people to absorb what is beneficial for them and discard what is harmful to them. All foreign cultures and thoughts cannot eradicate the thoughts of pre-China scripture. Instead, they are mutated, assimilated, and became part of Chinese culture.
<div>Today, under the torrent of globalization, the pre-China scripture has begun to play its roles in the world&mdash;to assimilate all religions and cultures, including Christianity. &quot;Globalization with Chinese characteristics&quot; are quietly growing. Christians must &quot;watch out; be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&quot; (Mark 8:15)</div>
</div>

<div li="B"><a>B.</a> The Essence of the pre-China Documents</div>

<div p="1">However, to dig into the pre-China scripture, it can be found that its core value is nothing but ambiguity. In essence, the pre-China scripture is a mixture of truth and falsehood without providing criteria for distinguishing between them. There is no fixed core value of the pre-China scripture&mdash;its core value is ambiguity and its content can drift freely and adapt in all kinds of environments. If one insists on having a fixed, mysterious super core value that people cannot know, it would have to be the same as the core value of the words of the Serpent in Gen 3:1-4, which is to obfuscate the Word of God.</div>

<div p="1">A crucial factor assisting the core value of ambiguity to freely drift is its obscure language. The Chinese language does not have grammatical forms of tenses and articles, which gives interpreters a loophole to meet the evil desire. This ambiguity not only effectively facilitates syncretism, which complicates who the prophetic Son actually is, but also creates lots of myths such as &quot;son&quot; in China, which is the secret power that saved the pre-China documents and attract people to make Chinese culture so great.</div>

<div li="C"><a>C.</a> The Nature of &quot;Son&quot; in pre-China Documents</div>

<div p="1">The paper discovered that, in pre-China documents, the top two most frequently used nouns are &quot;son&quot; ( <em>Zi</em> 子 rank seventh) and &quot;man&quot; ( <em>Ren</em> 人, rank 10th), respectively. Based on this, the pre-China culture can be called a son-centered culture.</div>

<div p="1">However, in post-China documents, especially after the <em>Han</em> dynasty (206BC&mdash;220AD), the order of the rank of the two words is reversed ( <em>Ren</em> 人, rank 13th; <em>Zi</em> 子, rank 42nd) -- Chinese culture shifts from a son-centered to man-centered culture.</div>

<div p="1">The analysis in the paper shows that the shift of &quot;son&quot; between the pre-China and the post-Chinese documents is very similar to the change in &quot;son&quot; between the Old and the New Testaments of the Bible. Moreover, the usual biological human definition of &quot;son&quot; cannot always fit into the pre-China documents or the Bible&mdash;both of them have another meaning of &quot;son,&quot; which made it widely used in all kinds of books.</div>

<div p="1">The difference is that, in pre-China time, the second definition of &quot;son&quot; (<strong>子)</strong> was widely used in names of well-known sages, such as 孔 <strong>子</strong> (Confucius), <em>Meng-Zi</em> 孟 <strong>子</strong> (Mencius), <em>Lao-Zi</em> 老 <strong>子,</strong> as well as seven unknown but mutually related &quot;sons&quot; (君子, 天子, 公子, 太子, 夫子, 王子, 父子), whereas, in the NT, the second definition of &quot;son&quot; is used to describe the dual sonship of Jesus Christ&mdash;the Son of God and the Son of Man.</div>

<div li="D"><a>D.</a> The Contextualization of &quot;Son&quot; in pre-China Documents</div>

<div p="1">The most significant work in this research is to be able to single out a group of seven different types of &quot;son&quot; that are most confusing but are substantial and uniquely related to each other. The paper finds that the seven divinely words (君, 天, 公, 太, 夫, 王, 父) used to describe the seven sons can be correctly used to describe the titles of the wonderful, prophesied Son in Isaiah 9:6-7.</div>

<div p="1">Such inter-cultural connection between the pre-China documents and the Hebrew Old Testaments provides an important key for the potential contextualization: the unidentified meaning of &quot;son&quot; in pre-China documents is identical to the &quot;son&quot; used for dual sonship&mdash;the Son of Man and the Son of God. The paper asserts that the seven unimaginable sons in pre-China documents are indeed one person pointing to the same unique Son of God as Jesus Christ in the gospel. The paper further points out that the misinterpretation of the seven sacred words is the reason to cause the myth of &quot;son&quot; in China until today.</div>

<div li="E"><a>E.</a> The Biblical View on the pre-China Documents</div>

<div p="1">This paper proposes a theory that during the pre-China time, the prediction of the advent of the Son of God is well-known throughout the land of China. However, the original purpose of the seeking the &quot;son&quot; is lost, just like the Nestorian Christianity has been lost in China&#39;s history. The missing information leaves a historical void until today.</div>

<div p="1">The paper believes that the predicting message in pre-China comes from Chinese magi rather than prophets. The difference between prophet and magi is that prophets can directly receive the Word from God, and their prophecy is accurate, whereas magi can only get the oracles through signs of nature or evil spirits, and their forecast is not explicit and secured.</div>

<div p="1">Pre-China scripture cannot be considered as prophetic literature. At least, history shows that pre-China documents could not lead people to come to Christ. Instead, it is inclined to mislead people becoming an obstacle to faith in Christ, increasing resistance to Him. Through its obfuscation of truth and falsehood, the pre-China scripture can only make people more crafty in their opposition to the gospel.</div>

<div li="F"><a>F.</a> An Evidence of Sinful Nature of Man</div>

<div p="1">The information extracted through pre-China documents shows that pre-China people failed to identify the predicted Son&mdash;they identified the prophesied Son with the wrong people, at the wrong time, and at the wrong place. It leaves a result that so many sages are considered to be the prophesied &quot;son&quot;, and the political leaders are entitled as the sacred &quot;son.&quot;</div>

<div p="1">The frequency-spectrum figures show that predicting features of &quot;son&quot; in <em>Ru</em>-family is most prominent. It infers that <em>Ru</em>-family is the first group of sages to spread &quot;son&quot; in China. The failure of prediction is likely a key factor to cause the son-centered culture to shift away in China, which further underscores the proposition that the vision of the foresight of the Son comes from magi rather than prophets.</div>

<div p="1">Although both the traditional Jewish and Chinese people are not able to accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God, Jewish people have been continuing to insist on waiting for the prophetic Messianic Son until today. Whereas, Chinese people totally gave up and turned the expectation to their biological offspring due to their shameful misidentification. From this point, Chinese people cannot be comparable with Israel&#39;s character as the chosen people of God.</div>

<div li="G"><a>G.</a> The Missiological Significance of the &quot;Son&quot;</div>

<div p="1">The evidence of prediction in existing pre-China documents can help to prove that the prophecy of the advent of Jesus Christ was prevalent over the world right before He came. Unless the prophecy had spread over the world, Jesus would not arrive. Likewise, unless the gospel will spread over to the end of the world, the end of the Days will not take place.</div>

<div p="1">The contextualization method is relatively new for many Chinese Christians or pastors. The successful fathom of the &quot;son&quot; in pre-China scripture could be proof for its advantages over the traditional indigenization method. It could be a useful tool in the inter-cultural study and spiritual warfare in world missions. Especially in current Chinese culture, the clarification of &quot;son&quot; is meaningful for local people and faithful to the gospel.</div>

<div p="1">Son-centered culture is not unique in China. It is related to many cultures with ethnic overpopulation like India and Japan. In such cultures, &quot;son&quot; has a special spiritual meaning for them directly related to eternal life. For them, the concern is more about sonship than the Trinity. It is almost impossible to happen in such a culture that all boys are ordered to be killed like Herod did (Mat 2:16). Killing their boys is more than ruining their life. However, in the Western, trinity has been debated for more than five hundred years, but the theological definition of &quot;son&quot; and dual sonship of Jesus is rarely studied and discussed. The sonship preference could be a reason to explain why it is so hard for the Western trinity-focused missionary to root the gospel in the ethnic overpopulation areas in the East. In the past decades, metaphysical sonship has been applied to science to formulate a successful Object-Oriented Programming method. If the theologians can define the biblical sonship and apply to the missiology and missionary fields, it can facilitate the gospel&#39;s taking root natively in China.</div>

<ol type="A">
</ol>

<div subpagesize="1"><a id="uid29" name="uid29" subpage_idx="">2.</a> Recommendations for Future Research</div>

<div p="1">(1) This paper found out that &quot;son&quot; has an unusual definition that is different from the human biological sense. But the paper failed to provide its theological definition due to its complexity. If the theological meaning of &quot;son&quot; can be defined, then it will be helpful not only for this research but also significant for the missionary to preach in the son-center culture.</div>

<div p="1">(2) The relationship between the son-center culture and ethnic overpopulation need to be explored further.</div>

<div p="1">(3) The archeological evidence about the origin of the son-centered culture need to be explored further.</div>

<div p="1">(4) Each pre-China document has multiple versions. Only one version is used in this study. To study the differences among them can help to verify the conclusion made in the paper.</div>

<div p="1">(5) More modern documents should be used in the research. If the frequency-spectrum can focus on the nouns, the data and evidence can be more accurate and convincing.</div>

<div p="1">(6) The same type of method can be used for the Chinese Buddhism study, its roles in China, as well as the relationship with the pre-China scripture and Christianity Scripture.</div>
