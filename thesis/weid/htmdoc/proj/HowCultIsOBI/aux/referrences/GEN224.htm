Full Text
A number of exegetes have adverted to a certain lack of continuity in the transition from Gen 2:23 to 2:24, and have therefore suggested, although in passing and with different emphasis, that the pericope on the creation of man and woman is complete with v 23, and that v 24 represents a secondary addition, an insertion, a gloss.[1] So far as I know, little attention has been paid to such remarks.[2] This paper proposes to verify their validity, and on the basis of this verification to reexamine the text and sense of Gen 2:24.

I. On the Literary Nature of Gen 2:24
To decide whether or not Gen 2:24 represents an ancient gloss one has preliminarily to determine its place within the literary unit to which it belongs and then to analyze its connections, both of form and content, with the elements of that unit.

As to its place, no particular examination is required. The verse is located within the passage 2:4b-3:24 which clearly consists of two stories (that of the creation of Adam and his wife, 2:4b-24; that of the fall of the first couple, 3:1-24) and a transitional sentence (2:25) which links the two.[3] The verse that is under scrutiny here occurs at the conclusion of the first story, a position that is tailor-made for an addition.

As to the connections of Gen 2:24 with the rest of the passage, a careful examination is required. Special consideration has to be given to the relationships of this verse with vv 18-23 and v 25, i.e., with the verses which immediately precede and follow it.

(1) Genesis 2:18-23 continues and completes the account of the creation of Adam (Gen 2:4b-8) with that of the creation of the woman. Judging it not to be a good thing (lo tob) that Adam be alone (lebaddo), Yahweh proposes to create for him "a corresponding helper (a helper fit for him)" (ezer kenegdo [v 18]). From the ground (min-ha adama) therefore he forms animals and birds, and brings them to Adam. He himself has to name all of them (v 19).[4] This Adam does, but without finding for himself "a corresponding helper" (v 20). Since, the Creator's purpose is not achieved in this way He moves on to a second procedure. He takes a rib from Adam (min ha adam), makes of it a woman, and leads her to him (w 21-22). Adam can exult:

wayyo mer ha adam
zo t happa am esem me asamay ubasar mibbesari
lezo t yiqqare issa ki me is luqoha zzo t[5]
And Adam said: "This, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh this one shall be called issa, because from is cannot be represented in text was taken this one.

This time (happa am)the objective has been achieved. Because of her very particular origin, which is here recalled (esem me asamay ubasar mibesari), the woman is implicitly recognized--she alone (zo t)--as the corresponding helper. By decreeing her name Adam exercises authority upon her;[6] he acquires her as a companion, and no longer will he be alone. By its very etymology, the name chosen for the woman (issa from is) will recall her origin and specify her function or position.

General consideration of the narrative's frame leads, therefore, to the conclusion that Gen 2:18-23 constitutes one unit which is complete in itself, firmly structured, and artistically arranged.[7] Special consideration of the conclusive v 23c (lezo t yiqqare...) leads to further insights. In fact, this saying (an etymological etiology)[8] is an important key. First of all, it discloses that the whole narrative of vv 18-23 (the creation of issa me is) is also an etymological etiology. In other words, with the help of the saying (v 23c), the description of the creation of the woman from man (vv 18-23) appears to be the transposition in concrete and living images of the popular etymology of issa from is. Thus there becomes more evident the deep coherence, even the interdependence, which exists between the saying and the preceding narrative.[9] Secondly, it discloses that the narrative of vv 4b-8 (the creation of adam apar min-ha adama), so close to the narrative of vv 18-23, is also an etymological etiology. Thus the interconnection between vv 4b-8 and vv 18-23 becomes more evident. Thirdly and consequently, it discloses the presence of a chiasmus (AB--B1 A1) that structures the whole narrative of Genesis 2-3 and extends from the story of Genesis 2 (creation of man and woman) to the story of Genesis 3 (fall of woman and man). In fact, this second story ends up, on the one hand, with the issa who compulsorily returns to is (el-isek tesuqatek) and, so to speak, is reabsorbed by him (hu yimsol-bak) (Gen 3:16, correlated to Gen 2:18-23), and, on the other hand, with adam who compulsorily returns to and is reabsorbed by the earth (subeka el-ha adama, el-apar tasub) (Gen 3:17-19, correlated to Gen 2:4b-8). Thus the interconnection of the first story with the second becomes evident. Both are part of a wider narrative. More particularly, it becomes clear that the etymological etiologies of 2:4b-8,18-23 are only the opening of a narrative which has its closing and its possible explanation in 3:16-19. Even a mediocre sensitivity[10] to artistic literary composition should be sufficient, at this point, to recognize Gen 2:24 as a foreign body, and therefore to label it as a gloss. But let us try to substantiate such an evaluation.

(2) Genesis 2:24 explicitly links itself, by means of the initial al-ken, "therefore," to the preceding story and derives from it a number of consequences:

al-ken ya-azob-is et-abiw we et immo wedabaq be isto wehayu lebasar ehad.

We may provisionally translate: "Therefore the man leaves (shall leave) his father and his mother, and cleaves (shall cleave) to his wife, and they become (shall become) one flesh." In the assumption that v 24 is a constitutive element of the story of human creation, eventually its conclusion, then two different interpretations are possible. One may interpret this verse as a deliberate continuation of the words pronounced by Adam himself. Having decreed the name (the role) of the woman/wife (yiqqare issa [v 23]), he now decrees the behavior of the man/husband towards her (ya azob-is...). One may also interpret it as a deliberate note that the author himself introduced, interrupting the narrative for a moment and making an observation prompted by what he has been narrating in vv 18-23. In either case, however, both the stylistic connection between v 24 and vv 18-23 and the consequences which v 24 draws from vv 18-23 prove to be forced.

If the first hypothesis (words of Adam) is assumed, one comes up against a discontinuity which is insurmountable even on the level of form: (a) In v 23 Adam begins his speech by making use of a poetic style (two stichs rhymed by three occurrences of zo t: the first at the beginning of the first stich; the second at the center, i.e., at the beginning of the second stich; the third at the conclusion), while in v 24 he would finish his speech making use of a prosaic, even pedantic form (ya azob... wedabaq...wehayu...).[11] (b) In v 23 Adam's speech moves backward from the decree concerning the name (v 23c: yiqqare . . . ) to its cause (v 23c, last part: (ki . . .), while in v 24 his speech unexpectedly would reopen and move forward from that very cause (recalled now by (al-ken) to a series of new consequences (ya azob... wedabaq... wehayu...).[12]

If the second hypothesis (note of the author) is assumed, the formal discontinuity just now observed may be partially[13] explained by the change of the subject who speaks. Nevertheless one comes up against a discontinuity which is now insurmountable especially on the level of content: (a) The premise of the story of w 18-23 is that Adam is alone (lo-tob heyot ha adam lebaddo [v 18]), hence the provision of the woman/wife; the premise of the note of v 24 is that the man is not alone, but in the company of his father and mother (ya azob-is et-abiw we et immo); a premise quite unexpected, contradicting in fact the premise of the whole preceding reasoning. (b) The conclusion of the story of vv 18-23 highlights Adam's happy acquisition of a companion (he has found the ezer kenegdo), while the conclusion of the note of v 24 is the cleaving of the man to his wife and their unification (to put it paradoxically, it is he who almost seems to be here the 'ezer kenegdah of the woman). (c) The story of human creation (2:4b-8,18-23) draws inspiration from popular etymology ('adam min ha'adama, 'issa me is), models its narrative as an etymological etiology, and explains (paradigmatically rather than etymologically)[14] the present situation of human beings only after the story of the fall (in 3: 16-19); the note on man's behavior towards the woman/ wife (2:24) takes advantage of the story of woman's creation (2:18-23), draws from that a series of inferences which add to the preceding story a supplementary and different etymologically value (indeed, not etymological),[15] and jumps immediately to explain (etymologically, not paradigmatically) a biological or a social phenomenon (see below, III). Is the author making therewith a (formally different) proleptic explanation? It is unlikely, because in this way he would introduce an awkward dissonance into his composition and, what is worse, a contradictory prolepsis: for there is contradiction in the picture of human reality given in Gen 2:24 and the picture given in Gen 3:16-19 (more on this point below).

Thus, passing from vv 18-23 to v 24, despite the initial al-ken one meets a double discontinuity (or better, incoherence) of both form and content. This is all the more surprising since it abruptly breaks the above observed continuity (or better, coherence and harmony) of the narrative. The only plausible explanation is that v 24 was added later by an author other than the one who composed the account of the creation of Adam and his companion, an author with talent and interests very different from those of the author of Gen 2:4b-8,18-23.

(3) Genesis 2:25 acts as a transition[16] which introduces the following story (Genesis 3):

wayyihyu senehem arummim ha adam we isto welo yitbosasu

The two were naked, Adam and his wife, without feeling shame.

The connection between this verse and the preceding one appears awkward. Verse 25, in fact, speaks of Adam (haadam) and his wife, and it begins by presenting them as two separate beings (wayyihyu senehem). Verse 24, however, speaks of the man (is) and his wife, and it concludes with a strong accentuation of the unity to which their joining together gives rise (wedabaq . . . wehayu lebasar ehad). If, instead, one omits v 24 and makes of v 25 the immediate continuation of vv 18-23, the transition from the first story to the second runs smoothly. In fact, the characters of v 25 are Adam and his wife, the same as those of v 23. The initial verbal form of v 25 (wayyihyu) is a wayyiqtol, the same as that at the beginning of v 23 (wayyo mer).

The connection then between v 25 and what follows is clear. The information given in v 25 that the two were naked (senehem . . . 'arummim) is correlative to the following presentation of the serpent as the most astute ('arum) of the animals (3:1), prepares for the discovery of their lost innocence when the eyes of the two (senehem) opened and they saw that they were naked (arummim [3:7]), and finds resolution with the information that God made coats for Adam and his wife and clothed them (3:21).

Thus, one finds that Gen 2:24 is inconsistent not only with the preceding story, but also with the verse and the story that follow. This inconsistency cannot be explained except by suggesting a different and later origin of v 24 not only in relation to Gen 2:18-23, but also in relation to the whole of the passage 2:4b-3:24. The theory according to which Gen 2:24 is a gloss seems to be well-founded.

Once the nature of Gen 2:24 as a gloss is established, the old problems relating to text and sense of the verse must be re-examined. Detached from its context from the literary point of view, the verse must be studied from textual and semantic points of view first and foremost in and for itself, rather than as an integral part of, and in function of, the passage in which it is found.[17] Such study does not appear to have been conducted up to now. This article represents an attempt in this direction.

II. on the Text of Gen 2:24
With regard to the determination of the text of Gen 2:24,[18] is a well-known problem has to be faced. Ancient versions (LXX, Pesh., Vg, and Tg. Pseudo-Jonathan are the most frequently cited in this respect) suppose the presence of a senehem (i.e., wehayu senehem lebasar 'ehad) which does not appear in the MT. Does this senehem, "the two," represent, as is usually accepted, a gloss introduced by these ancient versions, or was it already present in the Hebrew text used and faithfully reproduced by the translators, and afterwards omitted by the MT?

If the whole of v 24 is reduced (has to be reduced) to the level of a gloss, more precisely to a biblical (redactional) gloss, by this very fact the verse seems to rejoin and reincorporate that single word (senehem) which had previously been reduced by the decision of many to a translator's gloss; that is, it becomes plausible, henceforth, to consider the senehem as well as the whole of v 24 a redactional gloss (and no longer a translator's gloss). or should one continue to regard senehem as a gloss introduced in v 24 by the ancient versions and limit oneself to a linguistic revision, presenting it now as a translator's gloss on a redactor's gloss?

Let us take a closer look at the textual documentation. In favor of the presence of senehem in the Hebrew text of v 24 we have: Samaritan Pentateuch and the related Samaritan Targum (not just versions, therefore); the LXX and derived versions (including the VL); Jub. 3:4-8;[19] Philo (Leg. AIL II 49; De Gig. 65; Quaest. ad Gen. I 29); NT (I Cor 6:16; Mark 10:8; Matt 19:5; Eph 5:31); Pesh., Vg, Tgs. Frg. Cairo, Pseudo-Jonathan, and Neofiti. The array is impressive, because of the number of witnesses, the antiquity of some of them, and the variety of their socioreligious areas of provenance.

In favor of the absence of senehem we have Tg. Onqelos and the MT, only two witnesses; and these in effect may be reduced to one, since both come from the same ambience, that of rabbinic officialdom. The overall thrust of the textual documentation, therefore, prescinding even from further considerations, is such that unless one is a confirmed captive of the doctrine of the veritas hebraica (in reality, the myth of the veritas rabbinica), one is forced to consider as more probable the authenticity of senehem and to read the final part of Gen 2:24 wehayu senehem lebasar ehad.

In any case, in an examination of the form and content of v 24, other arguments come to light which indicate the appropriateness of the presence in the Hebrew text of senehem. The two initial verbal forms (ya azob . . . wedabaq) are in the 3d pers. sing., while the third verbal form (wehayu) is in the 3d pers. plur. Now, the sing. subject of the first two verbal forms, which is the same for both, once expressed after the first verb (ya azob-is), is correctly not repeated after the second (wedabaq); the plur. subject of the third verbal form, however, which as plural cannot still be the same, should have been expressed after the third verb (wehayu) by a senehem or by something similar. Not only the grammar (as seen), but also the thrust of the account appear to require this. The glossator is strongly underlining the fact that the joining together of man and wife gives rise to a unity. They become (they must become) basar ehad. It is unlikely, therefore, that he did not write (wohayu senehem lebasar ehad) and overlook the efficacious and spontaneous contrast between the "two" and the "one."[20] Everything points towards the fact, therefore, that the Hebrew text of the gloss Gen 2:24 contained senehem. Its absence in Tg. Onqelos and in the MT should be attributed to a decision of the rabbis. (For the motives that may have led to the choice of a text without senehem see below.)

These conclusions move one to consider another textual problem, smaller and less noticed, relating to the preceding v 23. Above, in keeping with common usage, Adam's words of v 23 were transcribed as given in the MT: "This one shall be called (issa ki me is), woman because from man...." There are, however, excellent witnesses (Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX and derived versions including VL, Jub. 3:7-8, Philo's Quaest. ad Gen. I 38, Tg. Onqelos) which indicate a slightly different Hebrew text, namely, issa ki me isah "wife because from her husband" (virago quia de viro suo). Here also the ancient textual documentation testifies in favor of the authenticity of me isah rather than (me is).[21] For confirmation of this reading one could perhaps appeal to the better assonance of me isah with issa, but me is)also provides good assonance. Confirmation is more likely to be found in the above-noted rabbinic choice in v 24 of a text without senehem. This makes it plausible that the same ambience (but later on: see Tg. Onqelos), moved by the same theological interest (see below), intervened with the concordant choice in v 23 of a text without the possessive pronoun-ah ("her," "of her").

Once the possessive pronoun is reintroduced into the Hebrew text and me isah "from her husband," is read, a further question inevitably arises. Is this possessive pronoun due to the pen of the author of Gen 2:18-23, or to the later intervention of the redactor responsible for the gloss Gen 2:24? The second hypothesis appears the more reasonable for two reasons. First, there is strong agreement between issa ki me is) (without the possessive pronoun) and ha adam . . . min ha adama (Gen 2:7) on the one hand (form's agreement), between issa ki me is and the whole of the story of Gen 2:18-23 (an anthropological, not a matrimonial text) on the other hand (content's agreement). Secondly, and vice-versa, there is strong agreement (both of form and content) between issa ki me isah (with the possessive pronoun) and wedabaq be isto . . ., i.e., the whole of Gen 2:24, as will be shown below.

III. On the Sense of Gen 2:24
With regard to the determination of the sense of Gen 2:24, the problem, admittedly, is not the general intention of the author. The initial al-ken ("therefore"), in fact, certifies beyond any doubt that he intends here to explain something, presenting it as a consequence of what has been narrated in the preceding verses (issa taken from Adam).[22] The problem rather is his specific intention; for what follows al-ken (namely, leaving father and mother on the part of is] and joining himself to his issa) gives rise to doubts as to what exactly the author intends to explain: marriage (a social institution) or "love" (a natural drive)?[23] With von Rad and Westermann the tendency nowadays is to discard the former in favor of the latter.[24]

This widespread opinion holds, on its negative part, that Gen 2:24 does not speak of marriage, either from an institutional (= matrimony) or from a personal (= matrimonial love) point of view, because there is no correspondence between the historically documented reality of Israelite marriage and the picture presented in this verse. The Israelite institution of marriage was ordinarily patriarchal and patrilocal, as Gen 2:4b-3:24 itself indicates (in 2:22 it is the woman wife who is brought to Adam; in 3:16 the woman wife receives the penalty of subjection to her husband). If Gen 2:24 were taken to speak of the institution of marriage, then incredibly it would present it as matriarchal and matrilocal (it is the man husband here who leaves his family and joins himself to the woman wife).25 Furthermore, Israelite matrimonial love was ordinarily the effect rather than the cause of the stipulation (taking account of the role the parents generally played and also of the youthful age of the contracting parties); and, in any case, the institutional structure of marriage foresaw that matrimonial love could be exposed to a fairly precarious course of events (taking account of the juridical customs of polygamy and divorce). If Gen 2:24 were taken to speak of matrimonial love, then incredibly this would be presented as the ordinary cause of the spousal stipulation and as the ordinarily unitary and stable support of matrimonial life.[26] These criticisms against a matrimonial interpretation of Gen 2:24 can hardly be contested.

The widespread opinion holds, on its positive part, that Gen 2:24 does speak tout court of "love" as it actually is, that love-force "stronger than death" (Cant 8:6)[27] which impels the man towards the woman and is capable of breaking earlier very solid bonds (those with the parents) to forge new ones. This would be the reality which the author links, as the effect to its cause ('al-ken), to the original ("creational") unity in Adam of man and woman; this is the reality explained through the etiology. Such interpretation is supported by the observation that, in this way, the discord between the historical reality and the picture presented in v 24 disappears (experience, yesterday as today, gives abundant proof of the dissolving and binding force of "love"; the anthropological nature of the topic would then explain why the matter is treated from the point of view of the man). These observations in favor of an anthropological interpretation seem well founded. Yet some difficulties remain and new ones arise.

First of all, it may be observed that Gen 2:24 makes no explicit mention of this "love," although it would not have been difficult to express it. Secondly, the strength of "love" is certainly known to the biblical writers and legislators. But they do not appear to have had the same romantic notion of it as some contemporary exegetes.[28] They generally perceived it as a source of prevarication, looking at it mostly with dismay, telling lurid tales about it for pedagogical purposes,[29] and adopting, with dissuasive intent, drastic legislative provisions.[30] The force of "love" with which the biblical writers and legislators occupy themselves seems to be, at least basically, a force which in itself is disordered and bizarre. Its correspondence with the picture presented in Gen 2:24 appears problematic. If this verse is taken to speak of "love," then incredibly it would present it as something ordered and stable (it detaches from the proper party correctly, as it attaches and unites to the proper party correctly). Thirdly, even if one wishes to admit, following the hypothesis under examination, the correspondence between the description given in Gen 2:24 and the historical reality of "love" which is normally presented by the biblical writers, it seems in any case arbitrary to suppose that the author wished to associate this reality with, or even worse to explain it (al-ken) as, the original work of the creator. The whole passage (Gen 2:4b-3:24), in fact, demonstrates great care in ascribing actual "love" to the consequences of the fall of the first couple. Its characteristics are described in Gen 3:16, and the picture presented there ("your desire shall be for your husband and he shall rule over you") is very different from that which is supposedly given in Gen 2:24.[31]

In the light of these observations[32] one is left very skeptical of the value of the interpretative hypothesis that is generally accepted today for Gen 2:24. There is a further decisive argument which leads to the firm rejection of the view that this verse speaks of "love," and to the recognition that it speaks rather of marriage itself. The text unequivocally states: wedabaq be isto, "and he cleaves (shall cleave) to his wife". it does not read be issa, "to a woman." It does not refer generically to the joining together of a man and a woman, but specifically to the joining together of a husband and his wife: wedabaq be isto wehayu senehem lebasar ehad.[33]

It is true that Bravmann sought to demonstrate that this be isto, "to his wife," is equivalent to be issa, "to a woman."[34] But his argumentation is anything but convincing.[35] We can directly wonder why Bravmann explicitly, and von Rad and Westermann implicitly, are induced to distort the text and to interpret the be-isto of Gen 2:24 as a be-issa The answer to this question is to be found in the initial phrase of Bravmann's study. He writes: "It seems important to state that instead of the phrase 'end shall cleave unto his wife' one might expect the phrase: 'one shall cleave unto a women' (in Hebrew: wedabaq be issa); this type of expression would seem to be more logical within the context as a whole."[36] If one takes v 24 to form a unit with vv 18-23, that is, to be an integral part (either as originally present or as homogeneously added later) of this unit, then one understandably tends to read v 24 in line with, and in function of, vv 18-23, and is therefore constrained, so to speak, to harmonize the one with the others, to transform the theme of v 24 which is clearly matrimonial[37] into an anthropological theme in keeping with that of vv 18-23,[38] and thus to interpret be isto as be issa.

Note that with such an approach to Gen 2: (4b-8),18-24 these interpreters proceed in a direction which is exactly the opposite to that of the glossator, thus nullifying his work. With the addition of v 24 and with the small gloss of v 23 (me isah), which presumably should also be attributed to him, the glossator first of all made explicit (probably adapting v 23) and then developed in a matrimonial sense (in any case adding v 24) the original anthropological theme of w (4b-8),18-23.[39] By overlooking the literary nature of v 24 (a gloss), interpreting its be isto as be issa and suppressing the probable gloss in v 23, modern interpreters remove the matrimonial theme and arbitrarily develop (not without distortions) the anthropological one.[40] This erroneous interpretation of be isto (and consequently of the whole of v 24) originates from the nonidentification (von Rad, Bravmann) or the insufficient consideration (Westermann) of the literary nature of v 24. The discord between the be isto of 24 and the issa of v 23 provides a valuable indication of the literary discontinuity between vv 18-23 and v 24. There is no need to eliminate this discontinuity in the search for the authentic text and sense. In any case, discontinuity should not be eliminated arbitrarily (Bravmann) or silently (von Rad, Westermann).

Having established that Gen 2:24 does not speak of "love" but rather of marriage, it is necessary to specify in what respect it does so. For the difficulties mentioned above remain to be overcome. In fact, the discord between the historical reality of Israelite marriage and its presentation in this verse leads interpreters to deny that Gen 2:24 gives a historical description (and explanation) of the institution of marriage or of matrimonial love.

The difficulties may be overcome by suggesting that Gen 2:24 speaks of marriage in a normative way; that is to say, it does not speak of marriage as it was, but rather as it should have been;[41] it explains marriage not as it was practiced (in particular,[42] indiscriminately exposed to polygamy and divorce), but rather as it should have been practiced (in particular, generically[43] linked to monogamy and indissolubility, wehayu senehem lebasar ehad). Within such a hypothesis, in fact, the lack of correspondence between historical reality and the matrimonial picture of Gen 2:24 ceases to represent a problem and becomes instead a necessary presupposition. It is the very presence of a marriage custom still anchored in arbitrary polygamy and divorce which justifies a norm and therefore also a correlative etiological foundation substantially antipolygamous and antidivorce. Within the same hypothesis also the fact that the object of the statement of Gen 2:24 is the man and not the woman ceases to represent a problem and becomes instead a further necessary presupposition. It is the very presence of a marriage custom in which the principal actor is the man that justifies a norm (and related etiology) predisposed for the man and not the woman. In actual fact, Israelite marriage was ad litteram a man "taking a wife"; and it was with the man that in Israel an indiscriminate use of polygamy and divorce usually originated.

For the reader, supposedly familiar with the generally accepted interpretation, the proposed interpretative hypothesis which takes Gen 2:24 to represent the hieros logos[44] of a norm which is generically antipolygamous and antidivorce will probably give rise to two questions, one of a grammatical-syntactical nature and the other of a historical-juridical nature.

The first question runs: is it syntactically legitimate to seek the significance of Gen 2:24 on the level of juridical etiology, that is, on the level of the explanation (foundation) of what one must do, and not on the factual level, that is, on the level of what one does? Is al-ken not perhaps the usual introduction to etiologies of names or current practices, that is, of existing realities? The answer is that even the norms are to be numbered among existing realities, and biblical writings in their own way frequently seek to give explanation of or legitimation for them. There is a whole series of juridical etiologies which link special norms of custom or law to illustrious institutional antecedents in order to provide them with foundations.[45] These etiologies are sometimes introduced, just as in the case of Gen 2:24, by al-ken.[46] Take, for instance, the etiology concerning the norm of the sabbath rest. It is a case of particular interest to the present discussion from a comparative point of view. Its rationale, which is indicated by the etiology of Deut 5:15 as stemming from what Yahweh has done as Israel's savior from Egypt, is indicated by Exod 20:11 as stemming from what Yahweh has done as creator. On the seventh day of creation he rested; for this reason he ordered that the sabbath should be observed. The glossator's argument in Gen 2:24 is similarly structured. God formed the woman by taking her from her husband. In consequence he orders that the man, having left father and mother, should be joined to his wife and be (return to be) one flesh with her.

The second and more important question runs: is it chronologically plausible to postulate, as the hypothesis under examination does, the presence of a norm which is generically antipolygamous and antidivorce at the time of the composition of Gen 2:4b-3:24? Does Gen 2:24 not perhaps form part of a passage which is usually regarded as one of the oldest in the Bible, ascribed as it is to the Yahwist? Is there not perhaps clear evidence still in the deuteronomic code of the legality of polygamy (Deut 21:15-17) and divorce (Deut 24:1-4; also Deut 22:19,29)?[47]

In reply one may point, first, to the literary analysis of Gen 2:18-25 conducted above and to its results. Once the nature of Gen 2:24 as a gloss has been established, it is no longer necessary to ascribe this verse to an ancient period or, in any case, to the time of the Yahwist. For the same reason, it is no longer necessary to reject on the basis of obvious anachronism the normative content of the etiology proposed above. There is no reason why the verse and its normative content should not be ascribed to the postexilic period.[48]

Secondly, one may point to the historical evidence (Mal 2:10-16; Leviticus 18 and 20; Ezra 9-10; Neh 10:30-31; 13:23-29) for the appearance and the consolidation, in the Jewish community of the advanced Persian period, of a reforming movement which led among other things to rigorous matrimonial legislation and jurisdiction. In particular, a double norm was adopted: (a) the prohibition of taking as a wife a woman of another race (= of another religion) or in a close degree of relationship or affinity; (b) the prohibition of taking a second wife while the first is alive (a norm which is therefore generically antipolygamous and implicitly antidivorce).[49] That in such a historical context, an etiology (on the lines of the suggested interpretation of Gen 2:24) could have been created to support the new legislation against arbitrary polygamy and divorce seems perfectly plausible, indeed probable.[50]

Thirdly, one may point to a number of indications which concur in suggesting a late postexilic date for the composition of Gen 2:24: (a) its etiology refers to the work of the creator (and not to that of the liberator);[51] (b) from the total absence of allusions to Gen 2:24 in preexilic and exilic writings one passes to the appearance in postexilic times of texts that are very close[52] and later on to frequent references to the verse in Jewish writings of the Hellenistic period. Such well-known texts as Tob 8:67,[53] Jub. 3;6-8,[54] LXX Gen 2:23-24,[55] Sir 25:26,[56] Philo's Quaest. ad Gen. I 29[57] witness not only to the important role of Gen 2:24 in this period, but also to the interpretation fundamentally identical (in a matrimonial and normative sense) which pre-Christian Judaism gave to this verse.[58] These texts thus provide also further confirmation for the interpretative hypothesis argued in this paper.

IV. Conclusion
The principal results to which the present investigation leads may be summarized as follows: (1) Gen 2:24 is a gloss which together with the small gloss in v 23 (me isah) was added to the story of the creation of man and woman in the late Persian period. (2) The Hebrew text of Gen 2:24 contained the term senehem. (3) The sense of Gen 2:24 is not that of an etiology concerning sexual drive or love, but rather that of an etiology concerning matrimonial legislation adopted in this period; referring to the work of the Creator himself, the glossator intends to explain and thus to found and better justify the new norm which was generically antipolygamous and implicitly antidivorce (Lev 18:18; cf. Mal 2:13-16), and perhaps also the new restrictive norms in the area of incestuous and mixed marriages (Leviticus 18 and 20; cf. Mal 2:10-12). These results bring about the necessity of reexamining, among other things, the authentic anthropological significance of the story of Gen 2:4b-8,18-23.[59]

[3] On such evaluation of the structural function of Gen 2:25, see below, I (3).

[4] I maintain the common opinion according to which the act of naming (at least the biblical one) involves the exercise of authority, e.g., the authority of the Creator over creatures, as in Gen 1:5,8,10; of parents over their children, as in Gen 4:25,26 (cf Luke 1:59-63); of kings over their servants, as in Gen 41:45; 2 Kgs 23:34; 24:17; of builders or conquerors over their cities, as in Gen 4:17; Num 32:38,41,42. See, for instance, G. von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1972) 81; Wenham, Genesis, 70. Yahweh leaves the act of naming the animals to Adam, and therewith he transmits power over animals to Adam. A different opinion was recently proposed by G. W. Ramsey ("Is Name-Giving an Act of Domination in Genesis 2:23 and Elsewhere?," CBQ 50 [1988] 24-35). According to him the act of naming would be an act of discernment. I wonder if some confusion was not made by the proponent between the act of choosing a name and the act of bestowing a name. The former involves discernment, the latter power, authority (not necessarily dominion). Evidently, to say that the act of naming involves an exercise of authority is not the same as to say that it involves the power to determine the essence of persons or things. See A. C. Thiselton, "The Supposed Power of Words in the Biblical Writings," JTS 25 (1974) 283-99, appropriately recalled by Ramsey, ibid., 31.

[5] In this first part of the study dedicated to the literary analysis of vv 23 and 24, the MT is accepted as it is. Textual questions are left for the second part.

[6] See above, n. 4. I am aware that the passive form (yiqqare) is used here, instead of the active form (wayyiqra) used in 2:20 and 3:20. But under different verbal forms the author seems to express the same event, unless we want to make of Adam (the speaker of 2:23) a seer and not a name-giver. See also B. O. Long, The Problem of Etiological Narrative in the Old Testament (BZAW 108; Berlin: Topelmann, 1968) 53.

[7] See particularly Westermann, Genesis 1-11 225, 231-33.

[8] See J. Fichtner, "Die etymologische Atiologie in den Namengebungen der geschichtlichen Biicher des Alten Testaments," VT6 (1956) 372-96; Long, Etiological Narrative.

[9] I agree with Long's comment on our passage: "the name itself is organically related to the bulk of the preceding narrative" (Etiological Narrative 54).

[10] I am appealing merely to "sensitivity." Those initiated into the technicalities of structuralist analysis deserve, of course, different and higher elaborations; see for instance D. Patte (ed.), Genesis 2 and 3: Kaleidoscopic Structural Readings (Semeia 18 [1980]).

[11] Not without reason do modern editions of the Bible generally distinguish orthographically between the poetic saying of Gen 2:23 and the prose of Gen 2:24.

[12] The supposedly unique speaker (Adam) would have rather proceeded either from the whole series of decrees back to the common cause, or vice-versa. Hence: lezo t yiqqare... we azabis... wedabaq... wehayu..., ki... (without al-ken), or vice-versa me-is luqohazzo-t, al-ken lezo t yiqqare... we azab-is... wedabaq... wehayu... (without ki): i.e., either "This one shall be called . . . and the man shall leave . . . and shall cleave . . . and they shall become . . . because . . ."; or "Therefore this one shall be called . . . and the man shall leave ... and shall cleave ... and they shall become...." On the other hand, if one had wished to stress consequentiality, one would have put: ki zo t happa am esem... al-ken lezo t yiqqare... we azab-is... i.e., "Because this, at last, is bone . . ., therefore this one shall be called . . . and the man shall leave...." It could be objected that a chiasmus is present here (vv 23-24). The response would be that it is not reasonable to propose the presence of a chiastic composition half in poetry and half in prose. The true chiasmus is the one recalled on p. 392.

[13] I say "partially" because it is surprising that a writer who displays great artistic talent in w 18-23 reveals himself quite incapable of combining what he supposedly says in v 24 with what he says in the preceding verses. Simpson, Early Traditions, 54, writes: "such a finished writer would scarcely have been guilty of breaking the thread of his narrative by a didactic notice of this kind." See also W. Fuss, Die sogenannte Paradieserzdhlung (Gutersloh: Mohn, 1968) 31, and the two not perfectly concordant opinions expressed by Long, Etiological Narrative, 53-54, 93.

[14] On such categorization see R. Smend, Elemente alttestamentlichen Geschichtsdenkens (Theologische Studien 95, Zurich: EVZ, 1968).

[15] See Long, Etiological Narrative, 89-93. He quotes Gen 2:24 among other examples of "inferential clauses with 'I-kn or Ikn which deal with something other than etymology."

[16] On the transitional function of Gen 2:25, see especially Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 234. B. N. Wambacq ("'or tous deux etaient nus, l'homme et sa femme, mais ils n'en avaient pas honte'(Gen 2,25)," Melanges biblia,ues en hommage au R. R Reda Rigaux ted. A. Descamps and A. de Halleux; Gembloux: Duculot, 1970] 553-56) underlines the prologue's function of the verse in relation to the following story. That seems sound, but Gen 2:25 does not seem devoid of the epilogue's function in relation to the preceding story either.

[17] For the same reason, Gen 2:18-23 should also be studied first and foremost in and for itself rather than as an integral part, and in function of, Gen 2:24.

[18] From a study of the history of the text's formation we pass now to a study of the ancient text's tradition. Given the presence of different readings of the same biblical text, the historical exegete has to compare them in the light of their socioreligious setting and provenance. He shall consider which reading could be primary and which secondary, which could represent a former stage in a textual history and which a latter one-all the more so, when the difference affects the sense and cannot be attributed to mere scribal oversight (recensional work is a reality in the history of the biblical text's transmission and it is not to be regarded as a reprehensible operation, especially in precanonical times). The questions will not necessarily find answers or perfectly sure answers; but sometimes the external documentary evidence together with internal critical analysis will afford arguments for a reasonable hypothesis. This is the case, I deem, for the textual differences that we are going to examine. The treatment itself will help to show the partial inconsistency of some recent theories on OT textual criticism. See E. Tov, "A Modern Textual Outlook Based on the Qumran Scrolls," HUCA 53 (1982) 11-27; M. H. GoshenGottstein, "The Textual Cnticism of the Old Testament: Rise, Decline, Rebirth," JBL 102 (1983) 365-99 (esp. p. 389 n. 84); J. Cook, "New Horizons in Textual Criticism," Text and Context: Old Testament and Semitic Studies for E C. Fensham (JsoT Supplement Series 48; ed. W. Claassen; Sheffield: JSOT, 1988) 51-61.

[19] Tosato, 11 matrimonio nel giadaismo antico, 71-73.

[20] It is also possible to consider (and to argue from) the devices used by the redactor for the insertion of his gloss. The former joining, the one between v 23 and the beginning of v 24, was forged by repeating the terms is and issa of the final part of v 23 (v 23: issa ki me is; v 24: is . . . le isto). We should thus expect to find the same technique used for the latter joining, the one between v 24 and the beginning of v 25. In actual fact, it is precisely the senehem in the final part of v 24 which constitutes this joining, anticipating the senehem of the beginning of v 25 (v 24: wehayu senehem . . .; v 25: wayyihyu senehem . . .).

[21] It was already the opinion of Simpson, Early Traditions, 54. He makes no remark on the text of v 24 probably because, according to him, the whole verse "must be deleted as a gloss" (ibid.).

[22] An in-depth study of the biblical use of al-ken is unfortunately lacking. Apart from the few lines dedicated to it in the grammars (E. Konig, Historisch-Comparative Syntax der hebraischen Sprache [Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1897] 538 and 615, Section 373 f-i and 415q; GKC, 492, Section 158b; R Jouon, Grammaire de l'hebreu biblique [Rome: Institut Biblique Pontifical, 1947] 523, Section 170h), one can cite two limited and partial studies: R. Frankena, "Einige Bemerkungen zum Gebrauch des Adverbs al-ken im Hebraischen," Studia Biblica et Semitica Theodoro Christiano Vriezen Dedicata (Wageningen: Veenman & Zonen, 1966) 94-99; H. Lenhard, "Uber den Unterschied zwischen Ikn und l-kn," ZAW 95 (1983) 269-72. Long (Etiological Narrarive) gives only the recurrences of al-ken in etiological passages. What can be said is that in a usage which appears fairly varied one constant feature emerges to provide the interpreter with a basic point of reference, namely, its function. Through the use of al-ken, something is linked to something else previously mentioned as a consequence to its antecedent and is explained by such a deductive connection.

[23] Of course, actually marriage does not exclude love, nor love exclude marriage. I am not setting up antithetic and absurd contrapositions. I am simply taking up the basic expositions of the main meaning of our biblical text, those which interpreters have been actually proposing. Note that the upholders of the second explanation ("love") speak in connection with Gen 2:24 of an etiology primarily concerned with sexual drive (see the following note). For the sake of brevity and clarity I will refer to their opinion using the word "love" with inverted commas.

[24] Von Rad (Genesis, 83) declares "our narrative is concerned not with a legal custom but with a natural drive (eine Naturgewalt)." He specifies this "force of nature" as "the extremely powerful drive (der urgewaltige Drang) of the sexes to each other" (p 82). Westermann writes: "Verse 24 is . . . appended to the narrative to explain the elemental power of love between man and woman, which is independent of any existing institutions" (Genesis: A Practical Commentary, 21; see also his Genesis 1-11, 233-34). This had already been H. Gunkel's and o. Procksch's interpretation, recalled by the preceding authors. See Gunkel's Die Urgeschichte und die Patriarchen: Daserste Buch Mosis (Schriften des Alten Testaments 1. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck Ruprecht, 1911) 57: Gen 2:24 speaks of "die Liebe" as "die Geschlechtsgemeinschaft," while "an die burgerliche Institution der Ehe oder gar Einehe ist nicht zu denken," and Procksch's commentary Die Genesis (KAT; Leipzig: Deichert, 1913) 30: "Nicht eine Rechtssitte, sondern eine Naturgewalt." Among the many who repeat this are Fuss, Paradieserza'hlung, 31; Long, Etiological Narrative, 53-54, 93; o. H. Steck, Die Paradieserza'hlung: Eine Auslegung von Genesis 2,4b-3,24 (Biblische Studien 60; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener V., 1970) 95; Weimar, Untersuchungen, 120; Phyllis Trible, God and the Rhetoric of Sexuafity (overtures to Biblical Theology; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1978) esp. p. 104 ("the one flesh of sexuality,""thus is Eros consummated',). Some (for instance Scharbert, Genesis 1-11, 53, and Wenham, Genesis 1-15, 69-71) pass over this interpretation in silence, and refer Gen 2:24 to marnage without giving any explanation of their choice. See instead the sound approach of Lawton, "Genesis 2:24," 97.

[25] In the past interpreters sought to resolve the difficulty by postulating that Gen 2:24 preserved traces of a matrimonial custom that had been practiced in much earlier times; see W. Robertson Smith, Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia (2d ea.; London: A. 3c C. Black, 1903; repr. New York: AMS, 1979) 207-8; and cf. W. Plautz, "Zur Frage des Mutterrechts im AT," ZAW 74 (1962) 9-30. The solution has long been abandoned. Its demise was due to the recognition that it was the fruit of evolutionary preconceptions rather than of biblical evidence correctly interpreted. The biblical authors lived in a society markedly patriarchal and patrilocal, and this is reflected in their writings. Individual cases of couples who contract marriage and reside in the wife's home are exceptions because of special circumstances; see, in this regard, F. Horst, "Ehe 11. Ehe im AT," RGG 11 (3d ea., 1958) 316-18; R. de Vaux, Ancient Israel 1: Social Institutions (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965) 19-21, 28-29. M. M. Bravmann ("The original Meaning of '. . . a man leaves his father and mother . . .', Gen 2,24," Studies in Semitic Philology [Leiden: Brill, 1977] 593-95 explains the apparently incongruous expression of Gen 2:24 by interpreting it not on a sociological but on a psychological level (on the basis of the Arabic proverb: "A son is a son till he gets him a wife; a daughter is a daughter all of her life"). The result, however, does not appear to be as far removed as he believes from the anthropological interpretation of von Rad.

[26] One could object that Gen 2:24 describes matrimonial love in its paradisiac perfection since at this point in the narrative we are still ante peccatum. This is true, but it seems that in v 24 the etiology ('al-ken) intends to explain something that exists today, referring it back to the creative work of God (narrated in w 18-23) as to its causal antecedent (generally on etiologies, see Smend, Elemente). The mention of father and mother in v 24 leads to the same conclusion. Von Rad, Genesis, 83, expresses himself strongly in this regard: "Its point of departure, the thing to be explained, is for the narrator [= the author of v 24] something in existence, present, not something 'paradisiacal' end thus lost!" He is followed by Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 233: "its goal is always the same: the existence of humankind as it is today."

[27] This reference to Cant 8:6 is cited both by von Rad, Genesis, 82, and Westermann, Genesis: A Practical Commentary, 21, as explanation and proof.

[28] Cf. Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 233-34; Genesis: A Practical Commentary, 21-22. The scholar expresses his surprise at finding remarkable agreement between the biblical passage and contemporary culture in the area of the conception and appreciation of human love (see Genesis 1-11, 234), and the present writer with him. But would it not then be reasonable to ask oneself if by chance the exegete is not acting as an eisegete, introducing into the biblical passage his contemporary culture?

[29] See, for instance, Gen 6:1-4; 12:10-20; 20;26:1-11; 34; 35:22; 38; 39:7-20;Judges 14-16; 19; I Kings 11.

[30] Remember the detailed penal legislation in the case of sexual and matrimonial crimes (for instance, Exod 22:15-16; 34:16; Leviticus 18 and 20; Num 5:11-31; Deut 7:3-4; 22:13-23:1; 24:1-4; 25:5-12; 27:20-23) and the commandments, Exod 20:14,17(?); Deut 5:18,21(?).

[31] The difference between the two descriptions of human love (that supposedly given by Gen 2:24 and that given by Gen 3:16) is recognized and accepted by Westermann, Genests: A Practical Commentary, 21-22, 25-26. He takes them to represent two sides of the same historical reality, two aspects that are complementary. But in separating corrupt from uncorrupt love, the good from the bad, one finds oneself, at least as far as Gen 2:24 is concerned, in the sphere of abstract love rather than that of love concretely experienced; one is at the level of the "paridisiac," against Westermann's own declared wish (see above, n. 26). Theoretically one could perhaps advance another solution for the contrast between the description of love given by Gen 3:16 and that supposedly given by Gen 2:24, observing (with J. Skinner, Genesis [ICC; 2d ea.; Edinburgh: Clark, 1930] 70) that Gen 3:16 speaks of woman's love, while Gen 2:24 speaks of man's love. But even the most ardent male chauvinist would surely hesitate to argue on the basis of Gen 2:4b-3:24 that the love of woman for man was perverted because of sin, while that of man for woman retained the perfection of its "creational" state.

[32] Another critical observation against the commonly accepted interpretation of Gen 2:24 is furnished by Lawton, "Gen 2:24," 97: "the verse [with such interpretation] sounds trite," "the verse strikes . . . as slightly jejune."

[33] The "matrimonial" interpretation of Gen 2:24 was still undisputedly accepted at the end of the last century; see, to cite only two well-known commentaries: F Delitzsch, Commentar uber die Genesis (Leipzig: Franke, 1872) 133; A. Dillmann, Die Genesis (EHAT 11; 5th ed; Leipzig: Hirzel, 1886) 68 (the narrator "erklart damn' die Ehe vom Schopfer geordnet").

[34] M. M. Bravmann, "Concerning the phrase 'end shall cleave unto his wife' Gen 1124," Mus 85 (1972) 269-74. Von Rad and Westermann pass over this point; they do not justify interpreting be'igro as be-'igga'.

[35] He appeals to some texts found in Arabic literature in which the possessive pronoun is held to be sometimes used pleonastically. This is a questionable interpretation; but, however that may be, Bravmann is not able to cite a single Arabic text which speaks of a man "and his wife" and which could be interpreted in the sense of a man "and a woman. " The abundant biblical evidence of 'igga with the possessive pronoun becomes all the more significant, evidence which Bravmann unfortunately overlooked. In this biblical syntagma the possessive pronoun always specifies the term 'igga in the sense of "wife." To ascertain this, one has only to look at the numerous cases listed in the biblical concordances. See further Tosato, n matrimonio israelirico, 79-81.

[36] Bravmann, "Gen 1124,269.

[37] This does not mean that v 24 is without its own anthropology, but only that it remains implicit; it is not the author's primary interest.

[38] That this should happen to von Rad is understandable, since for him "in this statement [= v 24] the entire narrative so far arrives at the primary purpose toward which it was oriented from the beginning. This shows what is actually intended" ( Genesis, 82). It is less understandable that Westermann should take a similar position. For him v 24 is an appendix which does not necessarily follow from the preceding account, but is rather an addition to an account which is in itself complete with v 23. Despite this, he writes in Genesis 1-11, 233: "The narrative 2:4b8, 18-24 belongs to the cycle of narratives about the creation of humankind [des Menschen, of the human being].... This is a narrative cycle that is completely sui generis in that its goal is always the same: the existence of humankind as it is today [das Menschsein des Menschen, the human characteristics of the human being]."

[39] One could theorize about the origins of such an adaptation. Pressed by urgent social needs of a new historical context, the glossator may have found the inspiration for his new matrimonial reading of the older creation story (Gen 2:4b-8,18-23: J) in the later creation story (Gen 1:26-28: P), especially where it tells of the simultaneous creation of zakdr dneqeba in ha'adam, and of the task (matrimonial par excellence) entrusted to them (pew urebu). In any case, it should be noted that Gen 2:4b-8,18-23, though anthropological in its original meaning, lent itself well to the matrimonial reading. From its very origin, in fact, the passage speaks of woman but has wife in mind. The woman is characterized by the model of the wife, the woman is essentially the wife (she is her function as wife). This older feminine anthropology is nothing but a "wifely" anthropology. The account reveals this both when taken as a whole (the woman created in function of the man) and in its details (the man who decrees the woman's name; see above nn. 4 and 6). Of note also is the spontaneous manner in which what is indicated in w 22 and 23 as "woman" ('issa) is referred to in Gen 2:25 as "wife" (ha'ddam we'ifto). Finally one may observe how the consequences of the sin for the woman (Gen 3:16) fall in reality on the wife. It is on the basis of all these observations that the glossator's adaptation can be indicated in terms of "explication" and "development."

[40] It is easy to understand that even the (basically correct) anthropological interpretation of Gen 2:4b-8,18-23 given by these scholars is destined to end up distorted-judging at least from the historical point of view. The (erroneous) anthropological reading of v 24 inevitably affects the interpretation of the preceding passage to the same extent in which it is connected to it. Now, as observed above (n. 38), both von Rad and Westermann from the point of view of content fully connect v 24 to vv 18-23 (a connection which is justified in von Rad's case, unjustified in Westermann's case). The critical reexamination of the original sense of Gen 2:4b8,18-23 that is called for cannot be conducted here. Suffice it to say that from the point of view of historical exegesis, what Westermann writes in Genesis: A Practical Commentary 26 ("in 2:21-24 man and woman are equals, and no trace of subordination is to be found',) seems to be incorrect: first, because he proposes only one undifferentiated consideration on the basis of a passage so internally heterogeneous as Gen 2:21-24; secondly and more importantly, because he reads into this passage a man-woman parity which is completely anachronistic; this misreading is probably the consequence of his failure to make clear distinctions in form and content in Gen 2:21-24. What Montefiore wrote in relation to rabbinic literature ("Women were, on the whole, regarded as inferior to men in mind, in function and status"; see C. G. Montefiore and H. Lowe, A Rabbinic Anthology LLondon: Macmillan, 1938; repr. New York: Schocken, 1974] xviii) is equally valid for biblical literature. Both literatures are expressions of an ancient Middle Eastern male society. De Merode ("Une aide," 331 n. 5) rightly draws attention to Montefiore's statement, citing it at length, but she does not appear to have learnt the lesson. Even in her case it is likely that the nonidentification of the nature of Gen 2:24 as gloss facilitated a mistaken interpretation of vv 18-23.

[41] See already Lawton, "Gen 2:24," 98.

[42] I take account here only of two matrimonial abuses, i.e., indiscriminate polygamy and divorce, possibly counteracted in the last part of our verse (wohayd senehem lebasar 'ehad). I leave aside for the moment (see however below, n. 50) two other matrimonial abuses, i.e., incestuous and mixed marriages, possibly counteracted in the first part of our verse (ya'azob-'i] 'et-'abfw we'et 'imm6 wedabaq be'isto). I deem it in fact possible, even probable because of coherence, that this first part of Gen 2:24 also hints at and has the technical sense of precise legal prohibitions, more or less those commonly recognized as present here by rabbinic interpretation (see the sources cited below in n. 58).

[43] If I propose to interpret Gen 2:24 as an etiology of an antipolygamous and antidivorce norm, let it be clear that this postulated norm, which is spoken of from now on, is not that specific antipolygamy and antidivorce norm which the Roman Catholic magisterial tradition felt it had to read in the NT writings. It is obvious that the postulated norm of the etiology of Gen 2:24 is solely concerned with arbitrary polygamy and divorce, and not with those that took place (had to or could take place) for a just motive (e.g., in the case of levirate, of adultery or sterility of the wife). From the absolute character of the formulation of a norm, one may not argue for the absolutely total extension of the matter regulated by the norm. Think of the precepts on the Sabbat rest, against "killing" (lo tirsah), against marriage with the brother-in-law. (This unfortunately overlooked principle should be relevant, of course, also for the interpretation of NT prohibitions formulated as well in an absolute form.)

[44] See I. L. Seeligmann,"Aetiological Elements in Biblical Historiography,"Zion 26(1961) 141-69 (Hebr.; Engl. summary, pp. i-ii).

[45] It happens, for example, in Genesis 17 (circumcision), Gen 47:26 (tax on the harvest), Exod 18:13-27 (judicial order), Num 27:1-11; 36:1-12 (inheritance of daughters), 1 Sam 30:25 (division of booty).

[46] This happens in Exod 13:5; 20:11; Lev 17:12; Num 18:24; Deut 5:15; 10:9; 15:11,15; 19:7; 24:18,22. Cf. also the sapiential precept of Qoh 5:1: "God is in heaven, you on earth; therefore (al-ken) few words with him."

[47] B. Vawter (On Genesis: A New Reading [Garden City: Doubleday, 1977] 75-76) excludes an interpretation in the sense of monogamous marriage, on the grounds that the Yahwist (taken to be the author of Gen 2:24), given the "social background" of his time, could not have conceived such an ideal.

[48] Note, on the one hand, that Fichtner ("Atiologie," 390-91) situates the etymological etiologies, including Gen 2:24, "im alten Sagengut" and, on the other hand, that Long (Etiological Narrative, 93) considers Gen 2:24 (together with Gen 32:33; 1 Sam 5:5; and Num 21:14,27) "a decadent stage in the history of this [= al-ken clauses] inferential structure." See also Weimar, Untersuchungen, 120 and Dohmen, Schopfung und Tod, 89-93.

[49] See A. Tosato, "The Law of Leviticus 18:18: a Reexamination," CBQ 46 (1984) 199-214. It was this earlier study devoted to Lev 18:18 that led to the present examination of the significance of Gen 2:24. This, in turn, suggests the desirability of a reexamination of Mal 2: 10-16, a passage treated briefly by the present writer in Bib 59 (1978) 548-53. Once one has identified an example of the choice made by the rabbis with regard to the text of the Torah itself (their adoption of a text without fenehem in the MT of Gen 2:24) and the obvious motive behind it (an interest in removing the emphasis upon the unity of "the two" and therewith its normative antipolygamous and antidivorce content), one feels less reluctant to accept the idea of an analogous rabbinic choice with regard to a "prophetic" text(the MT of Mal 2:10-16) which from the point of view of content is close to Gen 2:24. Hence the following hypothesis that in Mal 2:15 the reading should have been not welo' but halo (as in the preceding v 10: halo ab ehad; in v 10 the text refers to the original national statute, in v 15 to the original "creational" statute, and from both ethical and juridical consequences are drawn), and its double 'ehad should be linked to basar'ehad of Gen 2:24, with both referring back perhaps to that hd'dddm in Gen 1:26-28 who is "one" composed of two (note: in Gen 1:26, na aseh ddam; in Mal 2:15, ekad asa; in Gen 1 :28, peru urebu; in Mal 2: 15, uma ha ehad mebaqqes zera elohim). To sum up, the three passages (Gen 2:24; Lev 18:18; Mal 2:10-16) throw light on one another and should be taken together as expressions of the same period, the same ambience, and the same concern.

[50] Reading Gen 2:24 against the background of the suggested historical context, and in the light of the proposed explanation of the second part of v 24, it is tempting to interpret its first part as an etiology relating to the norm against marriages that are incestuous (ya azobis et-abiw we et immo) and mixed (wedabaq be isto: the one who is esem me asamay ubasar mibbesari) (see above, n. 42). Indicated here then would be which woman should and which should not be taken as a wife, while in the second pan of the verse how one should not behave towards one's own wife.

[51] The etiology of Exod 20:11 is reasonably regarded as later than that of Deut 5:15; see N. Negretti, n settimo giorno (AnBib 55; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1973) 159. One passes from a particularistic to a universalistic justification. The panorama of the first is limited to the ambience of one's own world, while that of the second considers Israel among the nations (and presumes that the practice is already consolidated in it). It is not improbable that a more close 57 and later on to frequent references to the verse in Jewish writings of the Hellenistic period. Such well-known texts as Tob 8:6-7,53 Jub. 3:6-8,54 LXX Gen 2:23-24,55 Sir 25:26,56 Philo's Quaest. ad Gen. I 2957 witness not only to profound knowledge of the historical development of the biblical use of al-ken (see above, n 22) would show that this particular use of al-ken as inferential clause in juridical etiologies is characteristic of the postexilic period.

[52] Cf. above, n. 49.

[53] From Tob 8:6-7 it is clear that Gen 2:18-24 acts as a normative matrimonial model. The bridegroom, in fact, at the beginning of the conjugal life (kai nyn . . . ego lambano ten adelphen mou tauten) turns in prayer to God who instituted marriage from the moment of the creation of the first couple (sy epoiesas Adam kai edokas auto . . . euan ten gynaiken autou), to God institutor and legislator of marriage. In what the creator said and did on that occasion, one finds not only an obligation of marriage (sy eipas: ou kalon einai ton anthropon moron), but also an obligation to contract it and to live it according to the law of truth (ou dia porneian . . . all 'ep'aletheias, "not according to a union of prostitution, but according to truth"); for this meaning of aletheia as "law of truth" see the respective Hebrew (kdt msh) and Aramaic texts (khikt wryt) in The Book of Tobit (ed. A. Neubauer; Oxford: Clarendon, 1878) xxxviii, 12, 30. As a result Tobit takes as his wife (tauter, v 7) her who was destined for him "from eternity" (6:18), and he promises to grow old with her (saute synkatagerasai).

[54] In Jub. 3:6-8, at the sight of the woman Adam exclaims: "`This is now bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. She shall be called my wife, because she was taken from her hushand.' Therefore shall husband and wife be one, and therefore the man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. In the first week Adam was created, and also the rib, his wife; in the second week he showed her to him...." Of note in this text is the fact that already from the creation of Adam God created in the unity of one body the matrimonial couple, man and his wife. Indicating the wife as already created with the rib of the husband, Jubilees presents as necessary and obligatory, by virtue of the creator's will, marriage, legitimate marriage (i.e., contracted according to the rules of connubium), monogamy, and indissolubility. Here too (see preceding note) marriages are preordained ab aeterno.

[55] The LXX interprets these verses in the sense of a matnmonial law. Indeed, not only does it present the gloss of v 23 (ek tou andros autes elemphtheb and v 24 in its entirety (with the senqhem: hoi duo), but it also translates the three verbs of the phrase in the future: kataleipsei . . . kai proskollethesetai . . . kai esontai ("shall leave . . . and shall attach . . . and shall be").

[56] Sir 25:26 should be considered as a probable addition of the Greek translator, both because of its absence from the Hebrew MS C of Cairo and because it differs from the teaching on marriage which Ben Sira gives elsewhere (cf. Sir 7:19,26a; 28:15); see Gilbert, "Une seule chair," 82. The verse reads: ei meporeuetai kata cheiras sou, apo ton sarkon sou apoteme auten, "if she (the wife) does not walk according to thy directives (lit.: according to thy hands), cut her off from thy flesh." The allusion to the command of Gen 2:24 seems clear. Sir 25:26 does not object to the content of Gen 2:24 (in particular to the obligation of indissolubility), but rather to an absolutizing interpretation of it which could already have been in circulation the interpretation of those who may have read in Gen 2:24 an almost unconditional obligation ("almost," because it remained open in any event to cases of obligatory divorce). Ben Sira's translator reads there a more conditioned obligation, more open to the casuistry of possible exceptions (included here in the category, certainly broad, of the insubordination of the wife to the husband).

[57] Philo also recognizes the presence of a matrimonial "command" in Gen 2:24: "(Scripture) commands man to act towards his wife with the most extreme exaggeration in partnership." This command seems conceived of as written in human nature itself and as ordered to a monogamous and stable marnage: "foreseeing the future (i.e., the future destination prescribed in the divine command to cleave to his wife and to be with her one flesh) he controls and stills his desires, being fitted to his spouse alone as if to a bridle" (Quaest. ad Gen. 1 29; tr. R. Marcus, Philo, Questions and Answers in Genesis [LCL; London: Heinemann, 1953] 17-18).

[58] It is hardly necessary to recall that rabbinic Judaism remains faithful to the same interpretative line (that is, matomonial and normative, differentiating itself however as to the content of the law), as is evident from the targums, talmudic writings (e.g., y Qidd. 1.1; b. Sanhedrin 57b-58b) and midrashic texts (e.g., Gen. Rab. 18:5); see A. Berliner, Targum Onqelos (2 vole.; Berlin: Gorzelanczyk, 1884) 2. 117, 226; R. Le Deaut, Targum du Pentateuque. 1: Genese (Paris: Cerf, 1978) 88-89; H. Strack and P Billerbeck, Kommentar zum Neuen Testament (6th ed.; Munich: Beck, 1974) 1. 802-3; Tosato, n matrimonio nel giudaismo antico, 51-58, 74-76.
