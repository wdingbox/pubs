Zhang Guangzhi: Continuity and Rupture——A draft of a new theory on the origin of civilization

As the new materials obtained from archaeological work in recent years have begun to enable us to gradually understand how civilization, urban life, and the state of society began to emerge in China, we have also begun to realize that the study of ancient Chinese history is based on the general principles of social sciences. The importance of. China has provided important data for testing a number of theoretical hypotheses in social sciences drawn up based on the Western History Research Institute, and we have found that a number of important hypotheses about the origin of civilization cannot pass this test. At the same time, China has provided enough information to draw up new social science laws from itself; how civilization started in China is a good example. The above two points—that is, certain Western general laws on the origin of civilization do not apply to China, and China provides its own general laws in this respect—of course are related to each other. A preliminary comparative study of China, Maya and Sumi civilization [1] shows that the Chinese form is likely to be the main form of the world's transition to civilization, and the Western form is really an exception. Therefore, the social sciences The general laws derived from Western experience cannot have universal applicability. I call the Chinese form the "continuity" form, and the Western form the "disruptive" form.

One of the most striking features of ancient Chinese civilization is that it was created ideologically within the framework of a holistic theory of cosmogenesis. In the words of Mou Fuli, "The true Chinese cosmology is a kind of organic procedural origin theory, which means that all the components of the entire universe belong to the same organic whole, and they all act as participants. Interact in a spontaneous life process". [2] Du Weiming further pointed out that this organic matter program "presents three basic themes: continuity, integrity and dynamics. All forms of existence, from a stone to the sky, are part of a continuum... Since there is nothing outside this continuum, the chain of existence never breaks. A chain relationship can always be found between any pair of things in the universe." [3] This kind of worldview in ancient China [4]—someone called the “connected cosmology”—obviously is not unique to China; basically, it represents the basic level of the human worldview [5] that has appeared in primitive societies. . The special importance of this cosmology in ancient China is the fact that an uncompromising civilization was established on its foundation and within its boundaries. Ancient Chinese civilization is a continuous civilization.


 
One, the shamanic universe is a witchcraft universe, and the phenomenon of so-called natural and supernatural environments is the result of witchcraft transformation, rather than the nihilism in the Judeo-Christian tradition. create".

Second, the universe is generally divided into multiple layers, with the lower world below the middle layer and the upper world above as the main distinction. The lower world and the upper world are usually further divided into several levels, and each level often has its own divine ruler and supernatural inhabitant. Sometimes there are the gods of the four directions or the four earths, and the highest gods who rule the heaven and earth respectively. Some of these gods control the fate of humans and other creatures, but they can also be manipulated by humans, for example, through sacrifices. The layers of the universe are penetrated by a central pillar (the so-called "axis of the world"); this pillar is conceptually and practically integrated with the shaman's various symbols of the upper and lower realms ascending and descending. The shaman also has a tree, or the tree of the world, on which there is often a bird—a symbol of flying in the heavens and transcending all realms—ascending. At the same time, the world is parallel north and south, the east and west axes are divided into four quadrants, and different directions are often combined with different colors.

3. Another axiom in the world of shamanism is that humans and animals are equal in quality, and, in the words of Herbert Spinden, “Humans are by no means the masters of the world, but always rely on For dinner."

Fourth, another concept closely related to the concept of equal qualities of humans and animals is the mutual transformation between humans and animals, that is, the ability of humans and animals to appear as each other since ancient times. The equality of humans and animals is manifested in the concepts of "intimate animal friends" and "animal companions." At the same time, shamans generally have animal assistants. In the ritual led by the shaman, the shaman and other participants put on the skins, masks, and other features of these animals to symbolize the transformation to their animal counterparts.


 
Fifth, all phenomena in the natural environment are given life by a kind of vitality or spirit. Therefore, there is no such thing as what we call "no living things" in the shaman world.

Sixth, the souls of humans and animals, or their essential vitality, generally reside in the bones, often in the bones of the head. Humans and animals regenerate from their bones. The skeletalization of Shamanism—that is, the ritualistic death and regeneration of a shaman from his skeletal state in his state of ecstasy, sometimes by starving until a handful of bones remain. It is often performed symbolically in shaman's instruments and in their art—also related to these concepts.

Seven, the soul can be separated from the body and can travel around the earth and even travel to the upper and lower realms; it can also be plundered by hostile elves or dark wizards and saved by the shaman. Loss of soul is a common cause of disease, and another cause is that foreign objects from a hostile environment invade the body. The diagnosis and treatment of diseases are the special skills of shamans.

Eighth, the last point is the phenomenon of ecstasy, which is often (not always or everywhere) promoted by plants that produce illusions.


 
After citing the above-mentioned characteristics of the shamanic worldview, Fowles went further and said: "Most of the above-mentioned characteristics are for the Spaniards within the scope of our knowledge to come to Mesoamerica and its symbols in the previous civilized era. The applicability of the system is not inferior to its applicability to the more typical shamanism in a simpler society. The theory of the origin of variants, rather than the biblical creation theory, is the hallmark of Mesoamerican religions. There are individual characteristics. The hierarchical universe of the rulers of the elven world, the axis of the world, the tree of the world with birds inhabiting, the mountain of the world, the four quadrants of the world, and the four squares with colors-these are indeed Central America. People and animals are there. The qualitative equality, animal close friends, animal companions, animal skins, claws, teeth, masks and other parts used to symbolize transformation or cause transformation, etc., are also Central American." [8]

I quoted a lot of Folster's [9] above, because many, or even all of them, were not less applicable in the early Chinese civilization than in Central America in the pre-Spanish civilization. We are referring to the fragile but dazzling remains of the following ancient Chinese symbols and belief systems: skeletal art in the Yangshao culture from 5,000 to 3,000 BC; the east coast of 3,000 to 2,000 BC Jade Cong and Yugui with beast and bird patterns in prehistoric culture; the worship of the gods of nature as seen in the oracle bone inscriptions in the Yin and Shang era (c. 1300-1100 BC), the earth of the world, the phoenix and the elves in the four directions , Hefeng is the title of emperor history; the animal images on the sacrificial vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties (approximately 1500-200 BC); the ancient Chinese thought of "the continuous existence of "qi" in all forms of existence" [ 10] belief; Eastern Zhou (450-200 BC) shaman poems in the Songs of Chu and its description of shamans and their rise and fall, and the call for lost souls in it. This type of evidence points to the ancient Chinese Shamanism at the core of the ancient Chinese belief and ritual system that values ​​the connection between heaven and earth. In fact, the witch character in the oracle bone inscriptions can be seen as an expression of the use of rules, and rules are the basic tools for mastering the circle (heaven) and the square (earth) [11]. Even the ecstasy of shamanism can be seen by the close connection between ceremonies and wine and the use of cannabis with ecstasy in ancient times (at least as early as the Eastern Han Dynasty) [12].

The detailed restoration of ancient Chinese shamanism [13] is not the purpose of this article. Some Sinology colleagues may express disagreement and cite various reasons to prove that such a restoration cannot have overwhelming evidence (I often hear about two reasons that the state of ecstasy is obviously absent in Oracle, and that it is not for business. Zhou Wenming must have progressed to the posthumous stage of the shamanism of the barbaric nation). Sure enough, this restoration cannot be 100%. But what we are discussing here is the overall situation rather than every detail that has not been saved in the data. In the context of making a major typological judgment, the question to be asked is: If this is not the case, then what is it? The important point is that the bottom of the Asian-American shaman restored by Forster and the general trend of the ancient Chinese world view are both connected cosmology. At the same time, in China, in the New World, the high-level civilization with urban life and national society is similar. The juncture is formed, and it does not harm the "existent succession."

At the beginning of the article, we said that the characteristic of Chinese civilization is that it was created within the framework of a holistic theory of cosmogenesis, but we did not mean to regard ideology as the main driving force for progress. The characteristic of the emergence of Chinese civilization, and other similar civilizations, is that in this emergence process, ideology serves as a major tool for re-adjusting the economic relations of the society to produce the concentration of wealth necessary for civilization. Specifically, our new theory includes the following necessary factors for the emergence of civilization:


 
First, the concentration of wealth shown in archeological civilization is not achieved in our view by the generally recognized means of increasing wealth and circulation such as innovations in production technology and trade. It is almost entirely achieved through the manipulation of productive labor. The increase in production is due to an increase in labor (caused by population growth and the capture of prisoners of war), by assigning more labor to production activities and by more efficient managerial skills. In other words, the relativity and absolute accumulation of wealth is mainly achieved through political procedures.

Second, as an important manifestation of the dominant position of political procedures, the fact that trade is mainly limited to the scope of precious goods, while the flow of strategic materials is usually realized by means of war.

Third, because the concentration of wealth is caused by political procedures (that is, the relationship between people) and not technical or commercial procedures (that is, the relationship between people and nature), the emergence of continuous civilization is not It leads to the destruction of ecological balance and can be realized in the framework of a continuous cosmology.

Fourth, in fact, the existing cosmology and social system are providing tools for political manipulation. The key to the manipulation lies in the social and economic stratification, and this stratification in China is manifested in three items that can be verified from archaeological and documentary data, namely clan branching, settlement hierarchy (leading to cities and countries) and The exclusive possession of the shaman class and shamanistic tools (including art treasures).


 
Fifth, among the above-mentioned various phenomena, the trend towards class society caused by population increase and religious branching is a well-known social phenomenon, and no further explanation is needed. Branch clans with various political and professional status are interlocked with the settlements that form a hierarchical system, and the institutions in them are also well known. But the third point mentioned above needs to be further explained briefly.

In the hierarchical universe, ancestors and gods live on the upper level. The strangers communicate with them through the help of animal companions and ritual instruments, including ritual instruments decorated with related animal images, through figures such as shamans or shamans. In a civilization like China that equates the power of ancestors or gods with the power to rule, the monopoly of shaman services and the possession of art treasures—that is, shaman instruments—is the society. Necessary conditions for the upper class. In this sense, the connected cosmology of the Asian-American grassroots itself becomes an ideological system that enables the ruler to manipulate labor and rearrange the relationship between human beings and his natural resources.

Chinese civilization should be one of many ancient civilizations that developed from the grassroots of ancient Asia and America through the political process represented by China. For social scientists who are familiar with Marx, Engels, Weber, Childe and other theories on social evolution and the rise of cities and the country, China's road to civilization seems to be a kind of deformation-often called "Asian style". The" deformation. According to these theories, at the stage of "civilization", as the word indicates, humans have reached a state of polite and gentleness, "different from barbarians, that is, rough people in the countryside" [14]. By definition, civilized people live in cities-elegant, refined, and accomplished in fine arts, in contrast to rural savages and prehistoric barbaric ancestors. At a deeper level, the contrast between urban and rural areas is also the contrast between culture and nature.

We can think of the growth process of a civilization as the gradual creation of a relatively large and complex environment by humans: this is not only through the increasingly powerful use of the wider range of resources in the ecosystem, but also in the natural realm. This is also true in the social and spiritual realms. At the same time, the environment in which savage hunters live is in many respects no different from that of other animals, although it has been expanded by the use of a large set of other artificial artifacts in language and culture, while civilized people live in saying It was indeed in the environment he had created himself. In this sense, civilization is an environment created by mankind himself. He made this environment to isolate himself from the primitive natural environment itself. [15]


 
The definition given by Colin Lunford has touched the core of a very common belief, that is, when humans have crossed the threshold of civilization from barbarism, he learned from a natural experience shared by him and his animal friends. In this world, he has entered a world created by himself, and in this world he surrounds himself with many artificial artifacts to separate him from his animal friends and lift him to a higher level ——These artifacts include huge buildings, characters and great art style.

This common definition of civilization contrasts sharply with the civilization we discussed above, namely the continuity of civilization-the continuity between humans and animals, the continuity between the earth and the sky, and the continuity between culture and nature. When these two different types of civilizations come into direct contact, this contrast can no longer be revealed:

Mexico (that is, the Aztecs) regards the relationship between their capital (Tenochtitlan) and its environment as an integrated cosmological structure—that is, an orderly universe in which natural phenomena are treated as Work is essentially sacred, alive, and closely related to human activities. This view is in contrast to the European view: the latter see cities as artifacts of civilization, that is, where religion and legal institutions sharply distinguish human identity from the natural body that has not been domesticated. . The monks and soldiers in Spain automatically regard themselves as human beings at a higher level than other forms of life in an order created by God. But the Indians treated natural phenomena with a sense of participation: the universe was seen as a reflection of the relationship between various life forces, and every aspect of life was part of an intersecting universe. [16]

The contrast between the Aztecs and the Spaniards mentioned here-or even the contrast between the grassroots of Asia and the Western social science theories-reminds us of two important implications of our new theory. Note: First, the theories of Western social sciences are generally generated from the historical experience of Western civilization, and they are generated from the historical experience of non-Western civilizations, and they may or may not be applicable to non-Western experiences. Be applicable. Second, and more importantly, the Western experience that produced the general theory applicable to a new social order must have represented a qualitative rupture from the grassroots shared by the rest of mankind from the very beginning. When we review the empirical prehistory that has been traced back to the Near East, we really see the formation of another type of civilization, and this type is characterized not by continuity but by disintegration—that is, the formation of a whole with the universe. The rupture of theory-the separation between mankind and his natural resources. The civilization that took this path was built on the basis of wealth accumulated by the technological revolution of production and the import of new resources in the form of trade. It is up to scholars of Western civilization to trace this path back to tell and explain the first breakthrough of human beings from the grassroots in Asia and America.
