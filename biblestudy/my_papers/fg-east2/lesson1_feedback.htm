(2) Culture and the truth cannot be divided in our life. At one hand, we are born and grew up in a culture. our physical life depend on the culture to maintain. On the other hand, Christians are reborn in the Holy Spirit. We no longer belong to this world. We are the children of the God, citizens of the kingdom of Heaven.

Culture has powerful influence in the world. But Christian must defeat the chains of any culture and let the culture to serve for God. Behind the culture it is the evil, the Serpent and the Dragon.

<div>Completely Agree:</div>

<div>Completely Agree: (1) The Gospel is the core of Christianity.</div>

<div>(3) The Gospel is the only way to redeem the sinners to lead Christians to break the prison of the culture to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</div>

In ACCC or Chinese missionary fields, we either preach and glorify the truth of the Gospel to expose the evilness of Chinese culture in public, or we make use of the Gospel to develop and unwittingly glorify the Chinese culture. There is no middle balanced ground here between the two. &nbsp;Chinese Christians should not keep any Chinese face but fully commit themselves to Christ. &quot;耶稣说、手扶着犁向后看的、不配进　神的国。&quot; (Luk9:62 CUVS) One takeaway from Pastor Yang is that we should not fear the powerful Chinese culture, but &quot;I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&quot; (Phl3:14 NIV) &quot;向着标竿直跑、要得　神在基督耶稣里从上面召我来得的奖赏。&quot; (Phl3:14 CUVS) He specifically reiterated that there is only one goal rather two or more balanced goals. ACCC should be more bravely to raise the Gospel and use the truth as the sword to expose the injustice, liars and wick influences from Chinese culture, and liberate His people free from the ruling or influencing from the ancient traditional culture, &nbsp;just like what Moses did to lead his people to get rid of Egyptian Pharisees to enter into the Canaan land that God promised. &nbsp;</div>
