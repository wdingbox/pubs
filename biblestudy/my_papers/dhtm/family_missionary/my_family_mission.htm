	<li>One night early in Jan of 2022, I had a dream: two coffins laid down in front of me on my way. &quot;Open it otherwise you are not permitted to pass through&quot; Being scared, I opened the left one and saw a face that I am very familiar with. But I could not remember his name no matter how hard I recalled.</li>
	<li>On Janunary 15 soon after I arrived in Atlanta, I suddenly got a shocking call from Beijing China--my father passed away. The ambulance insisted on me speaking in the phone that my father was dead when they arrived. I had to agree with them otherwise they could not go.</li>
	<li>I visited to them between Dec 2019 and Feb 2020. At time, I did not know it would be the last time I ever met him face to face. I wish I could receive my parents to live with us as soon as the pandemic is over. They are around 90 yeas old. But my wish is a wish of man. Now I have to go to take care of my mom: it started a journey of my personal family missonary, which turned to be an adventure in my life.</li>

<h5>application of the visa to China.</h5>

<ol>
	<li>At that time in China, Beijing held the World Winter Olympic Game. The pandemic is severe in China. The sino-usa relationship is the lowest point. The China consulates had policy: unless it&#39;s necessary and emergency, the application of visa would not be permitted.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I applied the visa with reasons necessary and emergent. After two weeks, I got approved.</li>
	<li>I flew to Seattle 15 days ahead of the trip to China.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All flights were locked down. I had to fly to Shanghai first.</li>
	<li>I was quaritined in Shanghai for twe weeks and spend 700 dollars (Rmb 500 per day with free meals).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The policy to Beijing: two weeks mandatory quaritine plus one week self-quaritine. (14+7)</li>
	<li>I was kicked out in the self-quaritine in Shanghai. We were allowed to find a hotel ourselves. The regular hotel is not allowed to live for allient.</li>
