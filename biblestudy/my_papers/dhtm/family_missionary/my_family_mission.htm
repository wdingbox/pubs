	<li>One night early in Jan of 2022, I had a dream: two coffins laid down in front of me on my way. &quot;Open it otherwise you are not permitted to pass through&quot; Being scared, I opened the left one and saw a face that I am very familiar with. But I could not remember his name no matter how hard I recalled.</li>
	<li>On Janunary 15 soon after I arrived in Atlanta, I suddenly got a shocking call from Beijing China--my father passed away. The ambulance insisted on me speaking in the phone that my father was dead when they arrived. I had to agree with them otherwise they could not go.</li>
	<li>I visited to them between Dec 2019 and Feb 2020. At time, I did not know it would be the last time I ever met him face to face. I wish I could receive my parents to live with us as soon as the pandemic is over. They are around 90 yeas old. But my wish is a wish of man. Now I have to go to take care of my mom: it started a journey of my personal family missonary, which turned to be an adventure in my life.</li>
	<li>family missionary is a mission impossible: A good solution is to give your family to the Church while you serve the Church: To let the Church finish his work.</li>
	<li>I am the only Chirsitian in my family.</li>

<h5>application of the visa to China.</h5>

<ol>
	<li>At that time in China, Beijing held the World Winter Olympic Game. The pandemic is severe in China. The sino-usa relationship is the lowest point. The China consulates had policy: unless it&#39;s necessary and emergency, the application of visa would not be permitted.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I applied the visa with reasons necessary and emergent. After two weeks, I got approved.</li>
	<li>I flew to Seattle 15 days ahead of the trip to China.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All flights were locked down. I had to fly to Shanghai first.</li>
	<li>I was quaritined in Shanghai for twe weeks and spend 700 dollars (Rmb 500 per day with free meals).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The policy to Beijing: two weeks mandatory quaritine plus one week self-quaritine. (14+7)</li>
	<li>I was kicked out in the self-quaritine in Shanghai. We were allowed to find a hotel ourselves. The regular hotel is not allowed to live for allient.</li>

			<h3>Get a Visa</h3>
		To go to beijing, the first thing needs to do is to apply the visa. I had ten years visa but it was canceled due to pandemic. I have to apply a new visa. The Jan of 2022 is the most difficult time to get the visa due to the pandemic and the political event-Winter Olympic Game. Without emergency and necessary reasons, no application would be accepted. After showing the death certificate, my application is not rejected. After two weeks, I finally got the visa. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Prepare the flight</h3>
			At the time of my applying visa, the earliest ticket to China I could buy is the March 3. The price is $3k, which is three times higher than I used to have. More over, I have to strictly follow the compicated pre-bording rules from China consulate: (1) began neclie test two week ahead. (2) PCR test one week and 3 days ahead at assigned clinic. (3) upload all testing results to consular and waiting for green code, without which boarding will not be allowed.      
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Flight Check in</h3>
			I was among the earlies passingers waiting for the checkin. All of them are Chinese. One of them had overweight package, and need pay hundred dollars. He did not have cridit card. So I help him to pay with my son's credit card and received his cash. But I was blemed by my family: it's none of your bussiness. No more in future.
			<br>
			Any way, I finally passed all regulations to be able to borad.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Custom Checkin</h3>
			<p>
				All passingers had two opions to fill the custom to China. One is the web everyone can link to. one is through the WeChat. I tried to avoid using wechat, but i find that the website is more troublesome than wechat.
			</p>
			<h3>First Day Arrived</h3>
			<p>
				I arrived in Shanghai on March 3rd. All flight to Beijing were melt down. I got 180 valid days for my visa. I will need a ticket or train to Beijing after 14 days required quarantine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Following the signs given I entered into an area waiting for the bus to transfer to quaritine center. All people would turned in the passport before to get in, which will be returned back after we got the assigned hotel.
			</p>
			<p>
				It took me for a couple of hours to get the quarintine center. The origianl signs showed that it is the Holiyday Inn. I paid about a thousand dollars for 14 days isolation, including the tax and three meals every day. The internet is free. But no google, facetime, gmail, yahoo etc. Fortunately, iphone message was still working. 
			</p>
			<p>
				my wife used to work in CISCO during 2000-2013. where about 40 employees from prc. Later I knew for the news that the company helped prc building a "great wall" that once Clinton mocked Chinese government it's impossible. After several years hot in market, my wife was laid off. Today the branch of CISCO in Atlanta was sold out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Sudden changes</h3>
				<p>
					The 14 days isolation was the easiest days for passingers: they do not worry about the food, drink or nucli-testing and other policies issues.  The price is relative good as comparied with others in Shanghai.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the 14 days isolation were finished, we are arranged to other place for another 7 days quarintine. The rules are less strict. For those local residents who have family, they can live at home. The most troublesome people are those who destinated to Beijing. This time the price of the hotel went up to one thousand rmb perday. I got diarea the second day in that hotel.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, the third day, we recieved a notice saying that: according to the instruction from up levels, the hotel will be empty immediately. One one is allowed to live here. Many people asked the reason but could not get better answer except the governmental instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had to look for the hotels. There are many cheap inns, but they do not accept the foreigners. Also we need to find out the necli testing centers near by in order to get a green code. 
				</p>
				<p>

				
				<h3>A help from a neighbor</h3>
				Li Dong was my classmate in ciu. I had contact him before to visit China. It is also my purpose to help the local church. When he knew that I was in difficult situiation, one of his member who was not a Christian yet was willing to prove me room in Shanghai. I prayed for that person that i never knew. He is one of my neighbors whom I need to love forever in my lifetime. He said he would pick me up the next day.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>A quick decision</h3>
				My heart felt peace after Li Dong ensure me that I won't wonder on the street. Very early the next moring, I checkout the room, walked around the building, I found that a underground stated is just across the road. I decided to enter it got go to the station to see if it is the true that I cannot enter Beijing.   
			</p>
			<p>
				The underground has a train to HongQian Railway Station. But it's hard for me to buy a ticket since I do not have wechat or other account. Fortunately, it's not busy at that time, and a service man led mo to a window to buy a ticket with cash. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After arriving the HongQiao Railway Station, I randomly asked a person nearby for the railway ticket window. She said "follow me". she was an employee of the station. Soon we stop at the gate and she passed through and went away. I thanked God and prayed for her. I do not have greencode, so have to show them all the papers I got during the isolation. They let me in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				--"I wanted to buy a railway ticket to Beijing. Here is my passport."<br>
				--"Do you have the green code?"<br>
				--"No. but I have all papers of necli testing, and I'm in hurry..."<br>
				--"Nobody is allowed to buy ticket to BJ unless he has the greencode."<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				--"Can I but a ticket to somewhere else except Beijing without the greecode? Like Xinji?"<br>
				After checking the computer for a little while, he replied,"Yes, you can have that." 
				It's a surprise to me. I think Shanghai is too expensive, although Li will help me, it is troublesome for him. If I can go to Xinji, I can live with relatives for awhile.
