        Early in 2022, I had a dream:  two coffins laid in front of me across my road. "Open it otherwise you cannot pass through" 
        Being scared, I opened the left one and saw a face that I am very familiar with. But I could not remember his name no matter how hard I recalled.

        On Janunary 15 soon after I arrived in Atlanta, I suddenly got a shocking call from Beijing China--my father passed away. 
        The ambulance insisted on me speaking in the phone that my father was dead when they arrived.
        I had to agree with them otherwise they could not go.

        I wish I could receive my parents to live with us as soon as the pandemic is over. They are around 90 yeas old. 
        But my wish is a wish. 
        Now I have to go to take care of my mom: it started a journey of my family missonary.

        family missionary is a mission impossible: 

        A good solution is to give your family to the Church while you serve the Church: To let the Church finish his work.
