<p style="line-height: 18px;">The "tonic" syllable is the syllable that receives the stress or accent; the "pretonic"
    syllable is the syllable before the tonic syllable, and the "propretonic" syllable is the syllable before the
    pretonic. Don't let this nomenclature intimidate you: in the Scriptures, accented syllables are usually identified
    with one or more accent marks (see below).<b><br><br><br>The Masoretes and the Masoretic Text</b><br>Between the 7th
    and 9th centuries A.D, a group of Jewish scribes called the Masoretes added vowel signs (<i>nikkudot</i>),
    cantillation symbols and accent marks (<i>ta'amim</i>) to the text. This process came to be known as the <i>Masorah
    </i>(tradition). The marked text was called the Masoretic Text and became the standard text for the Jews around the
    world.<br><br><img id="Picture100" height="20" width="63" src="../../../Grammar/Unit_Three/Word_Accents/ta_amim.gif"

        Text</b><br>Every word in the Tanakh (except those joined by a hyphen or maqqef) carries an accent mark on its
    "tonic" syllable (i.e., the syllable that receives the stress). In the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia there are 27
    prose and 21 poetic accent marks used in the text. These marks (like the vowel marks) may appear above or below the
    word.<br><br><br><b>Three Main Accent Marks</b><br>Most accent marks can be classified according to whether they are
    disjunctive (pausal) or conjunctive (connecting). </p>
