	<li>I used to be a materist and atheist.</li>
	<li>Educated under the socialism of China, I used to swear in the ceremony: be ready at anytime&nbsp;to give my life for the communism career. I was proud to wear the red scart. &nbsp;a&nbsp;deamed&nbsp;joyful&nbsp;society where&nbsp;all people are equal and can&nbsp;get what they&nbsp;wants based on their need,&nbsp;without exploiting oppression suffering.&nbsp;But in my real life, I&nbsp;was full of fear -- I feared to fail my exams, fail to speak wrong words to be judged as anti-revolutionist, fear to be smeared by others --&nbsp; I was deeply depressed inside.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>After I entered college,&nbsp;I began to be interested in Chinese Daoism, Buddism and all kinds of philosophies (Hegars, Sarter, etc).&nbsp;When I read those, I could temporily got some peace and comfort. But when I came back into the reality, I became more painful.</li>
	<li>The Tianmen mascres in 1989 is a typical example, my heart was totally broken, a friend comforted me, &quot;the sadness is not better than the death of soul&quot; (Indeed it is soul suicid)</li>
	<li>At that time, my only hope left is to leave China to my dreamed kingdom -- where has justice and freedoem.</li>
	<li>Howeve, very soon after I enjoyed the freedom. I encounter another pain -- my freedom had confliction with my wife and my family was nearly broken.</li>
	<li>No matter which status I ever had, my faith was based up the scietific evolutionary theory.</li>
	<li>After I came to usa, many Christians in church introduced me the Bible. However, whenever I read Gen 2:7 I threw away the Biblbe (I could not accept it.)<br />
	2:7 the Lord God formed a man[a] from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</li>
	<li>I felt that I was insulted. &quot;I was envolved from ape, how can i came from the dirty dust?&quot;</li>
	<li>One night when I slept in my car on the street, a voice came into my mind:<br />
	&quot;the verse is not about how man was created, what the verse wanted to tell you is that you are created.&quot;</li>
	<li>The holly Spirit, the love of God touched my heart. Since then a new life was born.</li>
	<li>I am full of hope, my sadness, angers were gone. replaced with joy, hope and happiness.</li>
	<li>I used to qurral with my wife all the time, lost temper quickly, beat my child. After the TP.</li>
