        <ol>
            <li>
                I used to be a materist and atheist. 
            </li>
            <li>
                As I grew up, I began to be interested in Chinese Daoism, Buddism and all kinds of philosophies (Hegars, Sarter, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
                When I read those, I could temporily got some peace and comfort. But when I came back into the reality, I
                became more painful. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Especially after 1989, my heart was totally broken, a friend comforted me, "the sadness is not better than the death of soul" (Indeed it is soul suicid)
            </li>
            <li>
                
                At that time, my only hope left is to leave China to my dreamed kingdom -- where has justice and freedoem.
            </li>
            <li>
                Howeve, very soon after I enjoyed the freedom. I encounter another pain -- my freedom had confliction with my wife and my family was nearly broken. 
            </li>
            <li>
                No matter which status I ever had, my faith was based up the scietific evolutionary theory.

            </li>
            <li>
                After I came to usa, some Christians in church introduced me the Bible. However, whenever I read Gen 2:7 I threw away the Biblbe (I could not accept it.)<br>


                2:7  the Lord God formed a man[a] from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
            </li>
            <li>

                I felt that I was insulted. "I was envolved from ape, how can i came from the dirty dust?" 

            </li>
            <li>
                One night when I slept in my car on the street, a voice came into my mind: <br>
                
                "the verse is not about how man was created, what the verse wanted to tell you is that you are created."   
            </li>
            <li>
                The holly Spirit, the love of God touched my heart. Since then a new life was born. 
            </li>
        </ol>
