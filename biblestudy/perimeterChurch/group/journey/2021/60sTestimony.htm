		<div><strong>A Quarral with my wife:</strong></div>

		<div>Few days ago, in a busy day, my wife and I worked together to prepare for the lunch.</div>

		<div>I wash the vegies, shrimps, she perpared cold dishes with spicy integrants.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Many times, after she eat spicy food, she got stomach ache and&nbsp;expressed regretful for eating the
			spicy.</div>

		<div>But after she recovered, she eat spicy again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>I gentlly said that spicy food is not good for her. Spicy is suject to make people hot temper.</div>

		<div>We should not eat food for good taste but for netrition.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>But she got angry: &quot;Are you hungry? if not, go back to your room.</div>

		<div>I felt very hurt. I cared for her, but she angry at me without any reason.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>I responsed: &quot;I can cooperate with you in cooking, and any routine work. But I cannot cooperate with
			you fire anger.</div>

		<div>If what I said is wrong, you can correct me. I do not want fire. I want live.&quot;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>I went back my room, my heart is blooding. I complained to Jesus, why did you give me a wife like this?
		</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Jesus did not say anyword to me at that moment, but He approached to me with love and peace without saying
			anything to me.</div>

		<div>I suddenly felt guilty.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>What Jesus tolerated in the world is much much&nbsp;hard than I did. As comparion, yours is nothing. Why
			should I complain?</div>

		<div>On the other hand, I am deserved to be treated like that or even worse. I am selfish, self-pride,
			self-centered person.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Each time after worship or fellowship, my heart is full of joy. But with my wife, I often got
			anger&nbsp;with my wife.</div>

		<div>As a comparison, I love church and fellowship more than my wife. I love Jesus word more than my wife&#39;s
			words, and any words in the world.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>The pain in heart made me to love Jesus more.</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>And the more I love Jesus, the&nbsp;less my pain was, &nbsp;I became to love my wife more.</div>

		<div>I clearly know that this love is different from the my old worldly love, but the love of Jesus.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>If she treats me well, if our life is as sweet&nbsp;as in the romantic movie, will I followed Jesus to go
			to missionary?</div>

		<div>I doubt it. From this point I thank my wife, I thank Jesus.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Jesus is great, so great and the greatest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Act 4:12.</div>

		<div>&quot;<strong>Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by
				which we must be saved</strong>.&quot; (Act4:12 NIV)&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&quot;除他以外、别无拯救．因为在天下人间、没有赐下别的名、我们可以靠着得救。&quot; (Act4:12 CUVS)</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>A few days ago, my wife and I had chance to eat with a Taiwanese in a dinner. His name is J.&nbsp;He
			graduated from GS&nbsp;in the chemical dept and now works in a company. He said he does not believe in any
			religion but&nbsp;he respects all kinds of religions.</div>

		<div>He told me that there are two kinds of Taiwanese in Taiwan: One is from the mainland before 1949. another
			is the natiave.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a native Taiwanese. His family came to Taiwan about four hundred years
			ago.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>He knows Taiwan culture a lot. &nbsp;He said, he doesn&#39;t like GMT party from mainland China. He
			supports independence of Taiwan.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Following his topic and his view point, I said:</div>

		<div>&quot;I also support independence of Taiwan.</div>

		<div>But I don&#39;t like Taiwan Presidential Inauguration Ceremony. Because it is full of the idolship. They
			bowed down to the picture of Sun who died a hundred years ago.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>We can respect him, but we should not bow down to his picture. God resents the idolship. That kind of
			ceremony will not bring the blessing but lead to tragedy.&quot;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>He said:&quot;I&nbsp;don&#39;t like the ceremony too. I epseically don&#39;t like the Taiwanese national
			flag. It is indeed a symbol for&nbsp;GMT party. However, These are part of the institution
			inherited&nbsp;from GMT party. No once can change it.&quot;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Howeveer, he also said that &quot;Taiwan is a freedom contry. There are many different religions like
			Daoism, Buddism, Islam, Catholic and Christianity etc in Taiwan. People can freely choose whatever he wants
			as long as he feels good. &quot;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>I said:&quot;I have experienced the communism and buddhism, Daoism. My experience told me that Christianity
			is the only correct one.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>He said:&quot;That is your experience. You cannot represent all.&quot;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>I said: &quot;There exist only one truth among all religions.&quot; I quoted act 4:12.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&quot;On one hand, a good country is not about its size or population, or its richness, it is about the
			happiness of the people, the peace of the people. Only the people who believe in God can be blessed.
			Taiwanese has only two percent of Christians, I hope Taiwanese can make use of the freedom to pursue Jesus
			Christ, so that Taiwanese can be saved. &quot;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&quot;On the other hand, the salvation is about the personal eternal life. What we believe is the most
			important thing for our life.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>

		<div>I think my conversation can lead him to think more about Christianity. At leaset I released an important
			message of the verse act 4:12.</div>

		<div>
			<hr />
			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>Audience: youth Taiwanese.</div>

			<div>My life is full of suffering. I grew up in an athesim culture, materialism world. trust the Marxism Mao
				theory, to believe a ideal&nbsp;communism world and sweared in oath&nbsp;to&nbsp;struggle wiith my life

				until i was seven. At the age of 3 or 4, my aunt brount me to join a mass meeting where I saw my grandma
				was caught on the stage with a white&nbsp;tag with a name. My heart was trembled since then.&nbsp; Later
				after I grew up, I knew my grandfather was put in prison and died there because of his connection to
				GMT.&nbsp;</div>

				<div>With a red scar on the neck, I raised my fist to make oak &quot;I am ready to give my life for the
					communism&quot; is my most proud day in my life.<br />
					&nbsp;</div>
			</div>

			<div>(3) In my&nbsp;fouth grade, one of my physical teacher disappeared suddenly. Later I knew he was put
				into prison because one of the airgun bullet he shot was found on a picture of Mao.&nbsp;I missed him
				and was sad for him.&nbsp;</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			</div>

				speak what official said. do not make a girl friend.&quot; His words prevented from prison. In the
				middle of my college, one of student with same grade was arrested because he wrote some words on table
				about the desiring of&nbsp;freedom like Taiwan.&nbsp;</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>(6)&nbsp; In the college, I spent time on Chinese phisolophy study. The most influential book for me
				was Zhuangzi/Daoism which led me to dream a status that union of heaven and body.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>(7) Daoism led me to pursue Buddism. But Buddism did not accept me.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>(8) 8964 is a biggest impact of my faith</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>(9) World peace pursuer</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>(10) 2001/9/11 changed me to Christian Faith.&nbsp;</div>

		<div>Dear Herschel,
			<div>&nbsp;
				<div>Thank you for your important reminder. Here is my reflection and experience to share within class.
					Please correct me for any kind of error or improper&nbsp;expression.&nbsp;</div>

				<div>&nbsp;</div>

				<div>Before I came to America, I had never heard of Easter day in&nbsp;China. After I came to America
					and before I was a Christian, I thought of Easter day as an egg hunting festival.&nbsp; It was after
					I became a Christian, I gradually knew the meaning of Easter day deeper and deeper. Your email makes
					me realize that Easter Day is the most important day among all holidays in&nbsp;the world. It is
					even more important&nbsp;than the most popular Christmas day when Jesus was born. Chrstmas day
					reminds us a good news (the Gospel) -- the Son of God came&nbsp;into the world and He showed us the
					way and truth, so that we did not need to bitterly explore or struggle for our ideal&nbsp;society by
					ourselves, and we can live with peace and love by following Him in the world. Whereas Easter day
					reminds us that Jesus won -- He had defeated all kinds of evils and gods, all kinds of crafty
					enemies, suppressors, all kinds of addictions and sins, and all kinds of powers of injustice both in
					air and on earth.&nbsp;Moreover, He defeated the most fearful thing for all of us that is
					death.&nbsp;</div>

				<div>&nbsp;</div>

				<div>Everyone wants to win. I used to explore Chinese Daoism, Confucius and all kinds of Chinese
					philosophies to get wisdom and soft power; I also used to explore Buddhism in order to get rid of
					the bitterness of life. But the deeper I dug into&nbsp;it, the more pessimistic I became. Right
					after 8964, a friend gave me a comfortable Buddhism wisdom: &quot;The sadness is not better than the
					death of your soul.&quot; Essentially, it infers a soul suicide.&nbsp;</div>

				<div>&nbsp;</div>

				<div>I have to give thanks to the church and all Christians who ever helped me. Most importantly, I have
					to give thanks to the Lord Jesus Christ. He forgave all my sins and removed all my evil
					addictions.&nbsp; I was baptized in 2003. After I turned to Him, the more I read the Bible, the more
					I enjoyed life.&nbsp;&quot;He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his
					name&#39;s sake.&quot; (Psm23:3 NIV) Because He was crucified on the Cross, He took over all my pain
					and sadness. Because He won, so I became a winner&nbsp;and all believers are the winners. Easter Day
					is the only true victory day that is worth celebrating in&nbsp;the world.&nbsp;</div>
