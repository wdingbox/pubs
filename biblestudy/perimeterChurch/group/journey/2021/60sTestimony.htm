<div><strong>A Quarral with my wife:</strong></div>

<div>Few days ago, in a busy day, my wife and I worked together to prepare for the lunch.</div>

<div>I wash the vegies, shrimps, she perpared cold dishes with spicy integrants.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Many times, after she eat spicy food, she got stomach ache and&nbsp;expressed regretful for eating the spicy.</div>

<div>But after she recovered, she eat spicy again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I gentlly said that spicy food is not good for her. Spicy is suject to make people hot temper.</div>

<div>We should not eat food for good taste but for netrition.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>But she got angry: &quot;Are you hungry? if not, go back to your room.</div>

<div>I felt very hurt. I cared for her, but she angry at me without any reason.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I responsed: &quot;I can cooperate with you in cooking, and any routine work. But I cannot cooperate with you fire anger.</div>

<div>If what I said is wrong, you can correct me. I do not want fire. I want live.&quot;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I went back my room, my heart is blooding. I complained to Jesus, why did you give me a wife like this?</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Jesus did not say anyword to me at that moment, but He approached to me with love and peace without saying anything to me.</div>

<div>I suddenly felt guilty.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>What Jesus tolerated in the world is much much&nbsp;hard than I did. As comparion, yours is nothing. Why should I complain?</div>

<div>On the other hand, I am deserved to be treated like that or even worse. I am selfish, self-pride, self-centered person.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Each time after worship or fellowship, my heart is full of joy. But with my wife, I often got anger&nbsp;with my wife.</div>

<div>As a comparison, I love church and fellowship more than my wife. I love Jesus word more than my wife&#39;s words, and any words in the world.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The pain in heart made me to love Jesus more.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>And the more I love Jesus, the&nbsp;less my pain was, &nbsp;I became to love my wife more.</div>

<div>I clearly know that this love is different from the my old worldly love, but the love of Jesus.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>If she treats me well, if our life is as sweet&nbsp;as in the romantic movie, will I followed Jesus to go to missionary?</div>

<div>I doubt it. From this point I thank my wife, I thank Jesus.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Jesus is great, so great and the greatest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
