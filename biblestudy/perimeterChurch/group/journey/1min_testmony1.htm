<ol>
    <li>I grew up in a very restrict family without love. To seek the truth and happiness was a goal in my life.</li>
    <li>I once firmly believed that the communism is a scientific truth but in 1989, I almost brought my head down to the grave in sorrow.</li>
    <li>In China, I used to pursue the truth and happiness in Daoism and Buddhism. But unwittingly I got depression and became a pessimistic person.</li>
    <li>In USA, some Christians introduced me the Bible, but I felt it was ridiculous, boring and irrelevant.</li>
    <li>It was the time in 2001 when I lost job and got desperate, God revealed Himself to me.</li>
    <li>I began to admit I was created rather than evolved from apes. After I confessed I was a sinner rather than a master of the world, the holy spirit came into my heart. </li>
    <li>I cried for several times. Very soon I found that my inner pain is replaced with Joyce. I don&#39;t need bitterly seek the truth because it is already revealed to everyone, which is Jesus Christ.</li>
</ol>




<hr />
<p>My name is William Ding, I am 59 years old now. My life was bothered by a concept for long time, which is a term called &quot;truth&quot;</p>

<ol>
	<li>I can still remember the day when I pledged alligence to the Chinese red flad in public to be a member of a red little guard in my 3rd grad: responding to a calling: &quot;For the communism,&quot; and we shouted: &quot;Ready at any time&quot; At that moment, my blood was boiling. I felt so proud for myselfe. I was like a great hero who was willing to die for truth.</li>
	<li>During the event of June 4th of 1989, I was among the students who would be willing to die for the truth. That moment I will never forget.</li>
	<li>While I though I was a great noble man, my inner heart was full of pain. I grow up in a family witout love. I used to get some comfort from Daoism teaching: be a winner through a loser, be a ruler through a slavery, get freedom to do anything wihout any actions. However, when I came into the world, I became more painful inside.</li>
	<li>I also tried to seek the truth and happiness in Buddhism. But the reality told me I could not be a monk living peacefully joyfully in a temple.</li>
	<li>When I was in USA, some Christians introduced me the Bible. However, in the beginning, I felt that the Bible is irrelevent, rediculous and boring. Especially, each time when I read Gen2:7, I threw the bible away -- it was totaly against my scientific Darwin&#39;s evolutionary faith, Also it is a kind of inssult to me: I was a noble man how could I be made of dirty dust? Marx also repeated reminded me: The religion is a spiritual opium, a way for the ruller to cheat and exploit the working class.</li>
	<li>My resistence to the word of God collapsed on a day after I lost my job, experienced confliction in family and become a homeless wonder on the street.</li>
	<li>In a dark night when I was sleeping in my car, a voice came to me: &quot;It is not about how God created man with dust, instead, what the verse wanted to tell is that &#39;you are created&#39;.&quot;</li>
	<li>Recalled my life experiences, none of them is what I designed or wanted. I had to admit &quot;I was created&quot; Since then I was able to understand what the Bible is talking about in the fellowship group study, what the pastors were preaching about in the church. I suddently felt the love of the Christians, the love of God. I suddenly surrendered, cried, and admitted I was not only a created being but also a sinner.</li>
	<li>After I admitted I was created by God, I am a sinner in front of God, I was completed changed. My eyes suddenly became bright, I know what is the truth. My heart is not painful anymore but filled with joy. I rejoice because of the salvation of God. I used to be filled with heatress and complains jealousness, but after the turing point, they significantly reduced. I once easily lose temper, but now I can controll it.</li>
	<li>I know that it is not me who ever did anything good, but it is totally the grace and mercy of God. I was not deserved it. what a mazing grace it is.</li>

<hr />
<p>My name is William Ding, I am 59 years old. Recall my life, it is a long and curved journey of faith.</p>

<ol>
	<li>I used to be a educated communism believer when I was in elemenary. I can still remember on the day when I pledged alligence to the red flad in my 3rd grad: a lead shouted: &quot;For the communism,&quot; and we shouted in the ceremony: &quot;Ready at any time.&quot; I felt proud to be a member of the red little guard member, I love to wear the red scart, I love the communism movies, communism story, love the communism songs, I hated the antirevolutionary and American imperilism. I wanted to give my life to the communism. I felt that I belongs to the bright people they what they called the righious. However, such faith was totally broken after experiencing the event of June 4th of 1989 mascres, which turned my 3-loves into 3 hate: motherland, people, ccp.</li>
	<li>Due to CR, I was sent to my grandmom&#39;s hometown in a contryside. When I came to Beijing up to live with my parents, I was 7 yrs old. In my memory, my parents are alway mean to me, full of punishment blames and scores. My parents always quarral. The one one I missed most in my life is my grandmon. But noone could understood me and I was deeply depressed.</li>
	<li>During my college, I began to seek self healing from Chinese Acient classic books. I was charmed to ba Daoist: be a winner through loser, a ruler through a servant. I also once wanted to be a Buddhist monk living in the Buddhism temple until death: However, when I came into the real life, I became more pain inside -- I had to deal with homework, career, marriage, human relationship and family issues.</li>
	<li>I also wanted to be a monk to live outside the world. But I was rejected somehow. I also read some Koran that encourage me to fight bravely, but I could not.</li>
	<li>Thanks God, in 1995, I began to study in USA where I first time began to read the Bible directly. In the beginning, I felt that the Bible is irrelevent, rediculous and boring. Especially, when I reached Gen2:7, I could hardly contiue to read further -- it was totaly against my scientific Darwin&#39;s evolutionary faith. Also Marx also told me: The religion is a spiritual opium a way for the captalists to cheat and exploit the working class. I thought that the Bible is a liar and I cannot be cheated again.</li>
	<li>I love the life in USA, but the life in USA was not what once dreamed for. Soon after Sep of 2001, I lost my job. At the same time I have serious confiliction with my wife. After a quarral, I left home and lived alone on street. In a dark night when I was sleeping in my car helplessly, a voice about Gen2:7 came to me: &quot;It is not about how God created man with dust, instead, what the verse wanted to tell you is that you are created.&quot; Recalled my life experiences, none of them is what I designed or wanted. Since then I was able to understand what the Bible is talking about in the fellowship group study, what the pastors were preaching about in the church. I suddently felt the love the Christians, the love of God. I suddenly surrendered, cried, and admitted I was a sinner.</li>
	<li> </li>

<hr />
<ol>
	<li>I used to be a materist and atheist.</li>
	<li>Educated under the socialism of China, I used to swear in the ceremony: be ready at anytime to give my life for the communism career. I was proud to wear the red scart. a deamed joyful society where all people are equal and can get what they wants based on their need, without exploiting oppression suffering. But in my real life, I was full of fear -- I feared to fail my exams, fail to speak wrong words to be judged as anti-revolutionist, fear to be smeared by others -- I was deeply depressed inside.</li>
	<li>After I entered college, I began to be interested in Chinese Daoism, Buddism and all kinds of philosophies (Hegars, Sarter, etc). When I read those, I could temporily got some peace and comfort. But when I came back into the reality, I became more painful.</li>
	<li>The Tianmen mascres in 1989 is a typical example, my heart was totally broken, a friend comforted me, &quot;the sadness is not better than the death of soul&quot; (Indeed it is soul suicid)</li>
	<li>At that time, my only hope left is to leave China to my dreamed kingdom -- where has justice and freedoem.</li>
	<li>Howeve, very soon after I enjoyed the freedom. I encounter another pain -- my freedom had confliction with my wife and my family was nearly broken.</li>
	<li>No matter which status I ever had, my faith was based up the scietific evolutionary theory.</li>
	<li>After I came to usa, many Christians in church introduced me the Bible. However, whenever I read Gen 2:7 I threw away the Biblbe (I could not accept it.)<br />
	2:7 the Lord God formed a man[a] from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</li>
	<li>I felt that I was insulted. &quot;I was envolved from ape, how can i came from the dirty dust?&quot;</li>
	<li>One night when I slept in my car on the street, a voice came into my mind:<br />
	&quot;the verse is not about how man was created, what the verse wanted to tell you is that you are created.&quot;</li>
	<li>The holly Spirit, the love of God touched my heart. Since then a new life was born.</li>
	<li>I am full of hope, my sadness, angers were gone. replaced with joy, hope and happiness.</li>
	<li>I used to qurral with my wife all the time, lost temper quickly, beat my child. After the TP.</li>
